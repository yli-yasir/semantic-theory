In particular, our identity needs lead us to consider how we will appear to others.We thus will tend to answer more in the positive rather than the negative, particularly if a leading question is used. We seek to acquiesce to the needs and direction of others, particularly when:They seem to be a superior in some way.
They have a need whereby we can easily help them.
Answering the question fully seems like hard work.People thus tend to agree with one-sided statements. They will also agree with two contradictory statements when they are framed for agreement.</theory:hasDescription>

Affiliation (nAff)
Power (nPow)Acquired Needs Theory is also known as the Three-Need Theory or Learned Need Theory.We have different preferencesWe will tend have one of these needs that affects us more powerfully than others and thus affects our behaviors:Achievers seek to excel and appreciate frequent recognition of how well they are doing. They will avoid low risk activities that have no chance of gain. They also will avoid high risks where there is a significant chance of failure.
Affiliation seekers look for harmonious relationships with other people. They will thus tend to conform and shy away from standing out. The seek approval rather than recognition.
Power seekers want power either to control other people (for their own goals) or to achieve higher goals (for the greater good). They seek neither recognition nor approval from others -- only agreement and compliance.Identifying preferencesA common way of discovering our tendencies towards these is with a Thematic Apperception Test, which is a set of black-and-white pictures on cards, each showing an emotionally powerful situation. The person is presented with one card at a time and asked to make up a story about each situation. </theory:hasDescription>

We have an upper limit to activation, beyond which we become overly stressed and fall into satisficing.People will seek activation through different types of stimulation, including novelty, complexity, variation and uncertainty. At a low level of activation, performance is decreased due to three factors:A lack of alertness
Dulling of the senses
Limited muscular coordinationThese in turn can lead to increased error or accident, and slower completion of tasks. Underactivation also leads to boredom and seeking of alternative stimulation (including by sabotage), unless the person has a low activation preference, where they are happy to daydream or otherwise be lazy.</theory:hasDescription>

In these cases, we will make dispositional attributions.We will also reverse the actor/observer difference when we are making negative conclusions.

        <theory:hasDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Things happen. We appraise them, assessing them against various criteria. We then feel emotions based on those appraisals.We do this in real-time, appraising and feeling as we go. We also do in reflectively, thinking further about what has happened and what may happen. When we think of the past or future we hence may feel good or bad about it.Primary appraisal is an assessment of how significant an event is for a person, including whether it is a threat or opportunity. Secondary appraisal then considers one&apos;s ability to cope or take advantage of the situation.A structural model of appraisal describes the relationships between:Perception: The environment and the person&apos;s perception of this
Appraisal: The person&apos;s appraisal processes that evaluate the perceived environment in terms of values on a set of measures called appraisal dimensions.
Mediation: The processes that relate appraisal values to the person&apos;s emotions.A process model of appraisal describes the detail of cognitive operations, mechanisms and dynamics by which the appraisal happens. In other words, the structural model is the static map and the process model is the dynamic operation.This is a cognitive approach to understanding emotions. Other theories view emotion as more reactive, without the opportunity to think. Indeed, we sometimes do not get the chance to think, for example when a fierce creature leaps out at us and we react with animal instinct that short-circuits the slower cortical appraisal. However, such reactive emotion is not necessarily how we feel in all situations.Originated in the 1940s by Magda Arnold, research was taken up in the 1970s by Richard Lazarus.Appraisal Theory is a Cognitive Appraisal Theory. It is also known as Lazarus Theory, after the originator.</theory:hasDescription>

        <theory:hasDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Infants have a number of component instinctual responses that bind the infant to the mother and vice versa, including sucking, clinging, and following, as well as the signaling behaviors of smiling and crying. These develop during the first year and continue through life into healthy adult relationships.When attached people (attachment figures) are separated three phases of separation response appear:Protest (related to separation anxiety)
Despair (related to grief and mourning)
Denial or Detachment (related to defence mechanisms, especially repression)Secure attachment is significantly related to maternal sensitivity. If the mother does not feel attached then the infant will not show secure attachment behavior.Note that two-way attachment is not the same as one-way dependency. An affectional bond may be one-way (eg. child to parent figure) or two-way (eg. a married couple) and leads to the person seeking to be physically close to the particular person to which they are attached. If they are separated, the person feels sadness and distress.As children develop, so does their motivational style going from fixed action patterns to to complex plan hierarchies with various sub-goals and ongoing goal correction.Perhaps unsurprisingly, Bowlby studied both attachment and loss, as the breaking of an attachment leads to a reversal in an equivalent sense of loss, which can have a deeply depressive effect.</theory:hasDescription>

        <theory:hasDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">We all have a need to explain the world, both to ourselves and to other people, attributing cause to the events around us. This gives us a greater sense of control. When explaining behavior, it can affect the standing of people within a group (especially ourselves).When another person has erred, we will often use internal attribution, saying it is due to internal personality factors. When we have erred, we will more likely use external attribution, attributing causes to situational factors rather than blaming ourselves. And vice versa. We will attribute our successes internally and the successes of our rivals to external ‘luck’. When a football team wins, supporters say ‘we won’. But when the team loses, the supporters say ‘they lost’.Our attributions are also significantly driven by our emotional and motivational drives. Blaming other people and avoiding personal recrimination are very real self-serving attributions. We will also make attributions to defend what we perceive as attacks. We will point to injustice in an unfair world. People with a high need to avoid failure will have a greater tendency to make attributions that put themselves in a good light.We will even tend to blame victims (of us and of others) for their fate as we seek to distance ourselves from thoughts of suffering the same plight.We will also tend to ascribe less variability to other people than ourselves, seeing ourselves as more multifaceted and less predictable than others. This may well because we can see more of what is inside ourselves (and spend more time doing this).In practice, we often tend to go through a two-step process, starting with an automatic internal attribution, followed by a slower consideration of whether an external attribution is more appropriate. As with Automatic Believing, if we are hurrying or are distracted, we may not get to this second step. This makes internal attribution more likely than external attribution.</theory:hasDescription>

Classical Conditioning is thus ‘learning by association’.In more detail, we are pre-conditioned to unconditionally respond in certain ways to stimuli. For example a sudden noise (an unconditional stimulus, US) makes us flinch (the unconditional response, UR). If a movement is made at the same time as, or just before the noise, such as moving hands to clap loudly (conditional stimulus, CS), then the person will learn to flinch when the movement is made without the noise necessarily being there (the conditional response, CR). Thus the association is made between the US and CS, with either stimulating the same response.Classical Conditioning  does not work in all circumstances. In particular it is more effective where the conditioning may be of evolutionary benefit. </theory:hasDescription>

How strongly the dissonant thoughts conflict.
Our inability to rationalize and explain away the conflict.Dissonance is often strong when we believe something about ourselves and then do something against that belief. If I believe I am good but do something bad, then the discomfort I feel as a result is cognitive dissonance.Cognitive dissonance is a very powerful motivator which will often lead us to change one or other of the conflicting belief or action. The discomfort often feels like a tension between the two opposing thoughts. To release the tension we can take one of three actions:Change our behavior.
Justify our behavior by changing the conflicting cognition.
Justify our behavior by adding new cognitions.Dissonance is most powerful when it is about our self-image. Feelings of foolishness, immorality and so on (including internal projections during decision-making) are dissonance in action.If an action has been completed and cannot be undone, then the after-the-fact dissonance compels us to change our beliefs. If beliefs are moved, then the dissonance appears during decision-making, forcing us to take actions we would not have taken before.Cognitive dissonance appears in virtually all evaluations and decisions and is the central mechanism by which we experience new differences in the world. When we see other people behave differently to our images of them, when we hold any conflicting thoughts, we experience dissonance.Dissonance increases with the importance and impact of the decision, along with the difficulty of reversing it. Discomfort about making the wrong choice of car is bigger than when choosing a lamp.Note: Self-Perception Theory gives an alternative view.</theory:hasDescription>

        <theory:hasDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Cognitive Resource Theory predicts that:1. A leader&apos;s cognitive ability contributes to the performance of the team only when the leader&apos;s approach is directive.When leaders are better at planning and decision-making, in order for their plans and decisions to be implemented, they need to tell people what to do, rather than hope they agree with them.When they are not better than people in the team, then a non-directive approach is more appropriate, for example where they facilitate an open discussion where the ideas of team can be aired and the best approach identified and implemented.2. Stress affects the relationship between intelligence and decision quality.When there is low stress, then intelligence is fully functional and makes an optimal contribution. However, during high stress, a natural intelligence not only makes no difference, but it may also have a negative effect. One reason for this may be that an intelligent person seeks rational solutions, which may not be available (and may be one of the causes of stress). In such situations, a leader who is inexperienced in &apos;gut feel&apos; decisions is forced to rely on this unfamiliar approach. Another possibility is that the leader retreats within him/herself, to think hard about the problem, leaving the group to their own devices.3. Experience is positively related to decision quality under high stress.When there is a high stress situation and intelligence is impaired, experience of the same or similar situations enables the leader to react in appropriate ways without having to think carefully about the situation. Experience of decision-making under stress also will contribute to a better decision than trying to muddle through with brain-power alone.4. For simple tasks, leader intelligence and experience is irrelevant.When subordinates are given tasks which do not need direction or support, then it does not matter how good the leader is at making decisions, because they are easy to make, even for subordinates, and hence do not need any further support.</theory:hasDescription>

When the behavior is not what we would have forecast, we assume that it is due to their internal preferences or character traits.Information about five factors is sought to make these inferences:Whether the behavior being considered is voluntary and freely chosen.
What is unexpected about the behavior (‘non-common effects’).
Whether the behavior is socially desirable.
Whether the behavior impacts the person doing the inferring (‘hedonic relevance’).
Whether the behavior is of personal interest to the person doing the inferring (‘personalism’).</theory:hasDescription>

Exception: if the event occurred because of a non-routine action that might well not have happened (&apos;if only...&apos;).
Controllability: if something could have been done to avoid the event.
Action: in the short term, we regret actions that cause problems more than inaction that might have the same effect (although in the longer term, this effect is reversed).We can also do the reverse, thinking about bad things that did not happen, such as when we narrowly avoid being in an accident.

Distinctiveness: how similarly the person acts in different situations, towards other stimuli.
Consistency: how often the same stimulus and response in the same situation are perceived.People tend to make internal attributions when consensus and distinctiveness are low but consistency are high.

Becoming engrossed in an interesting task, such as a hobby.
Meditation and other contemplative activities.Deindividuation as  person moves into a group results in a loss of individual identity and a gaining of the social identity of the group. When two groups argue (and crowd problems are often between groups), it is like two people arguing. The three most important factors for deindividuation in a group of people are:Anonymity, so I can not be found out.
Diffused responsibility, so I am not responsible for my actions.
Group size, as a larger group increases the above two factors. When you are in a group, you may feel a shared responsibility and so less individual responsibility for your actions. In this way a morally questionable act may seem less personally wrong. You may also feel a strong need to conform to social norms.A paradox of deindividuation is that when you let go of your self, returning to you self can be an exhilarating experience. This is one of the rewards of engrossing hobbies and meditation.Significant external stimulation helps deindividuation as it distracts you from internal chatter and rumination. This is one reason that pop and rock music (and orchestral music, for that matter) is often played loudly along with dramatic visual lighting effects.</theory:hasDescription>

We therefore need to control these and a key part of childhood is spend in learning this discipline. We also need to do things that we do not necessarily want to do, which also requires inner control.There are a number negative emotions that we may experience, from anger to fear, yet in social situations there is a common value that such emotions should be suppressed rather than expressed. Such control also takes ongoing effort, peaking at the moments when there internal pressure to say or do something that might later be regretted.This self-management takes constant emotional and cognitive effort. In these acts of self-control and will-power, some acts take more effort than others. Overall, though, there is almost always some ongoing effort in staying socially acceptable.We have limited resources for this task, which can run low, leaving us exhausted and vulnerable. In this state we may make more errors and our decision-making ability may well be impaired. We may also be more liable to outbursts, such as of anger or shock. As control loosens emotions intensify, including positive ones, and the person may become more excited.In a Freudian sense, this self-control uses the conscious &apos;ego&apos; to control the basic desires of the &apos;id&apos;. Hence as it gets worn down through exercise, the ego becomes depleted.Ego depletion tend to result in greater attention to the short term with priority being given to this and consequent ignoring of longer-term factors. This can lead to unwise decisions.The depletion that is caused may be restored to some extend by rest and positive experiences. It has also been found that ingesting glucose has a significant restorative effect. This depletion and restoration has contributed to the metaphor of will as a &apos;muscle&apos;.</theory:hasDescription>

In this way, rewards can decrease internal motivation as people work to gain the reward rather than because they like doing the work or believe it is a good thing to do.In effect, extrinsic motivations can change a pleasurable into work.There are three primary types of extrinsic motivation, as in the table below: Motivation	Behavior sustained by...	Example
External motivation	...environmental reward or punishment contingencies.	Do work because paid to do it.
Introjected motivation	...desire to avoid internally imposed guilt and recrimination.	Do work to earn money to sustain family.

When we are sufficiently motivated, we can actually change what we remember.People are better at creating false memories when asked to imagine the supposed event in detail, and if they are also good imagers.We can also easily create a false memory when two things are similar. For example we may be sure a specific person was at an event when actually it was someone else who looked like them.False memory can appear when we want something to have happened just because it is pleasant to recall.This is caused by what is sometimes called &apos;imagination inflation&apos;.</theory:hasDescription>

Closing eyes, nodding off
Lack of alertness
Drowsiness
Socially withdrawn
Moodiness, quick to anger
Sore eyes
Depression
Lack of self-regulation
Impaired decision skillsPhysical fatigue reduces the ability to perform physical activities such as running and lifting. Fatigue also affects cognitive functioning and it becomes harder to think and make effective decisions. This is significant wherever choice is important, such as for doctors and nurses, soldiers, etc.We like choice as it gives us a sense of control. Yet increased choice requires more cognitive effort, which is more tiring, causing decision fatigue. This can lead to people preferring less choice, which can seem counterintuitive (Iyengar and Lepper, 2000).</theory:hasDescription>

This can be detected via lie detectors, speech errors and hesitations, repetitions, fidgeting and displacement activity, blinking, higher vocal pitch and pupil dilation.
Behavior control: We try to control body language that might give us away. In fact this is impossible and leakage often occurs, for example where we are controlling our face and our legs give us away.
Emotion: Our emotions change when we are lying. For example, duping delight, where the liar is secretly pleased at their perceived success. Guilt may also appear. Micro-motions in facial muscles can betray hidden emotions.
Thinking: To lie, we usually have to think a lot harder, such as to ensure coherence in our arguments. This leads us to take longer in speaking with more pauses. We also tend to use more generalities to avoid getting trapped by specific detail.</theory:hasDescription>

Thus the closer you are, the more frustrated you get by being held back. Unexpected occurrence of the frustration also increases the likelihood of aggression.Frustration does not always lead to aggression, particularly when we deliberately suppress it because either we know that it is wrong or we fear the social consequences of being aggressive (eg. losing friendship of target, criticism from others). As a result, we often displace aggression into other activity, such as sports, driving fast and so on.Some people are more predisposed to aggression and find it harder to contain it. For such people, frustration is more likely to that lead directly to aggression than for other people with a calmer disposition or greater self-control.</theory:hasDescription>

We also know little about how they are interpreting the situation.Western culture exacerbates this error, as we emphasize individual freedom and autonomy and are socialized to prefer dispositional factors to situational ones.When we are playing the role of observer, which is largely when we look at others, we make this fundamental attribution error.

Challenging, so we will be stimulated and not be bored.
Achievable, so we are unlikely to fail.If other people set us goals without our involvement, then we are much less likely to be motivated to work hard at it than if we feel we have set or directed the goal ourselves.FeedbackWhen we are working in the task, we need feedback so we can determine whether we are succeeding or whether we need to change direction. We find feedback (if it is sympathetically done) very encouraging and motivating. This includes feedback from ourselves. Negative self-talk is just as demotivating as negative comments from other people.Directional and accuracy goalsDepending on the type of goal we have, we will go about achieving it differently.A directional goal is one where we are motivated to arrive at a particular conclusion. We will thus narrow our thinking, selecting beliefs, etc. that support the conclusion. The lack of deliberation also tends to make us more optimistic about achieving the goal.An accuracy goal is one where we are motivated to arrive at the most accurate possible conclusion. These occur when the cost of being inaccurate is high. Unsurprisingly, people invest more effort in achieving accuracy goals, as any deviation costs, and a large deviation may well more. Their deliberation also makes them realize that there is a real chance that they will not achieve their goal. When we have an accuracy goal we do not get to a &apos;good enough&apos; point and stop thinking about it--we continue to search for improvements. Both methods work by influencing our choice of beliefs and decision-making rules.</theory:hasDescription>

Collective efforts to rationalize or discount warnings.
Unquestioned belief in the moral correctness of the group.
Stereotyped views of the out-group, often as too evil, weak or stupid to be worth bothering with.
Self-censorship as people decide not to rock the boat.
Pressure to conform.
A shared illusion of unanimity (everyone always agrees with everyone else).
Protecting the group from contrary viewpoints, by self-appointed ‘mind-guards’.As a result, groups &apos;suffering&apos; from group think are more likely to:Be dogmatic.
Justify irrational oor decisions.
See their actions as highly moral.
Stereotype outsiders.Groupthink happens most often when the group is already cohesive, is isolated from conflicting opinions and where the leader is open and directive.

When searching for a word for a particular situation, the more available words that pop into our minds first become more available and consequently keep coming back when we try to think of other words.As we get worn out by this fruitless task, our ability to control the situation weakens, we get stuck in the cycle and thinking can easily turn into saying and doing. Repetition also tends to strengthen our belief in what we are thinking, as in Mere Exposure Theory.This spiral can easily fall into obsessive-compulsive behaviors and many psychological disorders include an inability to stop thinking about something uncomfortable.</theory:hasDescription>

        <theory:hasDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">We have experiences, and as a result, our autonomic nervous system creates physiological events such as muscular tension, heart rate increases, perspiration, dryness of the mouth, etc. This theory proposes that emotions happen as a result of these, rather than being the cause of them.The sequence thus is as follows:Event ==&gt; arousal ==&gt; interpretation ==&gt; emotionThe bodily sensation prepares us for action, as in the Fight-or-Flight reaction. Emotions grab our attention and at least attenuate slower cognitive processing.This is not a new theory and was proposed in 1884. It combined the ideas of William James and Danish physiologist Carl Lange, who largely independently arrived at the same conclusion. William James described it thus:&quot;My theory ... is that the bodily changes follow directly the perception of the exciting fact, and that our feeling of the same changes as they occur is the emotion. Common sense says, we lose our fortune, are sorry and weep; we meet a bear, are frightened and run; we are insulted by a rival, and angry and strike. The hypothesis here to be defended says that this order of sequence is incorrect ... and that the more rational statement is that we feel sorry because we cry, angry because we strike, afraid because we tremble ... Without the bodily states following on the perception, the latter would be purely cognitive in form, pale, colorless, destitute of emotional warmth. We might then see the bear, and judge it best to run, receive the insult and deem it right to strike, but we should not actually feel afraid or angry&quot;Lange particularly added that vasomotor changes are the emotions.It was largely supplanted by the Cannon-Bard theory, but of late, it has made something of a come-back, although the notion of causality is not as strong and there is ongoing uncertainty as to the chicken-and-egg question of which comes first, physiological and emotional feelings.</theory:hasDescription>

Acknowledgement: Realizing the pleasure of gaining their attention.
Hope: Imagining having the love reciprocated.
Delight: Happiness with the inflated view of the other person&apos;s beauty and merit.More recently, Sternberg describes three styles of love:Intimacy: Closeness to, and liking of, the other person.
Passion: Intense longing and physiological arousal. Ecstasy on reciprocation, despair on rejection.
Commitment: The readiness to do anything for the sake of the love.These combine to create seven styles:Liking: Intimacy alone
Infatuation: Passion alone
Empty love: Commitment alone
Romantic love: Passion + Intimacy.
Companionate love: Intimacy + Commitment
Fatuous love: Passion + Commitment
Consummate love: Intimacy + Passion + CommitmentThe games of love are played on six different stages, and individuals will have preferred modes (Lee):Eros: Passionate and physical. Looks are important.
Ludus: love as a non-serious game. Harm is not intended but often happens.
Storge: slow-growing, evolving out of friendship and affection. Similarity is important.
Pragma: Commonsense and pragmatic. Known conditions must be met.
Mania: An emotional roller-coaster. Stereotyped romantic love.
Agape: Unselfish and giving. Spiritual and other-focused.Peterson and Seligman reduce love to three prototypical forms:Romantic love
A child’s love for a parent
A parent’s love for a childLove can be viewed as a form of transference whereby one person puts a part of themself into another person and then feeling lost without that part, and subsequently feeling whole again when they relate to that person.</theory:hasDescription>

Evolution has taught us that survival and prosperity is more likely if we live and work together. However, to live together, we need to agree on common beliefs, values, attitudes and behaviors that reduce in-group threats act for the common good.We thus learn to conform to rules of other people. And the more we see others behaving in a certain way or making particular decisions, the more we feel obliged to follow suit.This will happen even when we are in a group of complete strangers. We will go along with the others to avoid looking like a fool. However the forces are strongest when we care most about respect and love from others in the group. Thus families and friends can apply very strong normative influence.People with lower self-esteem and who crave approval of others may well be more easily influenced this way.When a person in a group does not conform, then they may be considered a deviant and both private and public advice may be given to them on how to fit in. If they still do not obey norms, they will eventually be ejected and membership of the group revoked.National culture also has a significant effect, and people in countries like Japan, who have collectivist cultures, are far more likely to be influenced than in more individualistic cultures, such as in the USA (although it is a testament to the power of this effect that it still has a massive impact here).</theory:hasDescription>

The result is a confusing combined experience of two emotions being felt at the same time that normally are mutually exclusive.

        <theory:hasDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Optimism bias is the tendency to believe that we are more likely to be successful, and otherwise experience good things, than actual probabilities predict. In particular, we tend to be more optimistic about our own chances than we do about other people.Optimism bias can be assessed by asking people how likely they are to fail or experience something negative as compared with others. Many of us think they will face less risk and negative outcomes than others.With regard to emotion, being optimistic makes us feel better for longer. When we believe we will benefit from a future event, we feel good about this as we think of ourselves in that situation and feel anticipatory pleasure. Even if the event does not happen, we only feel bad at that time and can easily move on to other positive thinking, such as when we tell ourselves &apos;It&apos;ll be better next time&apos;.There are evolutionary benefits for optimism. Optimistic people will try more things that those who are more cautious. Certainly, over-optimism can lead to at best a waste of time and at worst loss of life. Yet even this helps evolution of people who have the right amount of optimism. Overall, optimism and consequent experimentation leads to learning and that some people, at least, will make breakthroughs that would not be achieved if we were all more realistic. This spreads beyond humans as animals will also display optimism.Optimism is affected by temperament, where some people are generally more optimistic than others. It is also affected by shorter-term mood, for example a person who is feeling depressed is less likely to be optimistic. Indeed, those who are depressed or who are generally in a negative frame of mind may tend towards an opposite, pessimistic bias. Optimism is also moderated by caution and the desire to avoid or reduce risks.Selective memory tends to affect optimism when we recall past successes and positive events more easily than negative ones (which we may ignore or suppress).Other factors that affect optimism include:The degree of control a person believes they have.
The amount of support they person thinks they have from other people.
The successes the person has had in the past.
Where action is necessary and caution is not likely to be helpful.
Tendency towards self-confidence, arrogance and other thoughts that create cognitive self-bias.
The perceived probability and impact of the desired event.
The perceived probability and impact of negative events should the desired event not occur.
The extent to which we have told other people we will succeed.Optimism is also encouraged within many cultures, where being positive receives more desirable feedback and being negative leads to criticism or less desirable feedback. In other words, we prefer people who are optimistic. Even when we know they are probably wrong, cheerful people who think the future will be good make us feel happier.</theory:hasDescription>

        <theory:hasDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">People develop internal models of reality, called constructs in order to understand and explain the world around them in the same way that scientists develop theories. Like scientists, they develop these constructs based on observation and experimentation. Constructs thus start as unstable conjecture, changing and stabilizing as more experience and proof is gained.Constructs are often defined by words, but can also be non-verbal and hard to explain, such as the feeling you get when your football team just won the championship.When constructs are challenged or incomplete the result is emotional states such as anxiety, confusion, anger and fear.Constructs are often polar in that they have opposites (and are hence dichotomous). Thus the construct of good implies another of bad. Polar constructs create one another: thus &apos;good&apos; cannot exist without &apos;bad&apos;. When poles are denied, they are said to be submerged.Although we share the idea of constructs through words, the detail of constructs are particular to the individual and hence are called personal constructs.Constructs that are important to the person are core constructs, whilst others are called peripheral constructs.Constructs may be expanded (dilated) to accommodate new ideas or constricted to become more specific.Kelly&apos;s (1955) basic postulate is that &apos;A person&apos;s processes are psychologically channelized by the ways in which he anticipates events&apos;. He followed this with eleven corollaries.The construction corollary: We conservatively construct anticipation based on past experiences.
The experience corollary: When things do not happen as expected, we change our constructs (thus reconstructing). This changes our future expectations.
The dichotomy corollary: We store experience as constructs, and then look at the world through them.
The organizational corollary: Constructs are connected to one another in hierarchies and network of relationships. These relationships may be loose or tight.
The range corollary: Constructs are useful only in limited range of situations. Some ranges are broad, whilst other ranges are narrow.
The modulation corollary: Some construct ranges can be &apos;modulated&apos; to accommodate new ideas (e.g. &apos;big&apos;). Others are &apos;impermeable&apos;.
 The choice corollary: We can choose to gain new experiences to expand our constructs or stay in the safe but limiting zone of current constructs.
The individuality corollary: As everyone&apos;s experience is different, their constructs are different.
The commonality corollary: Many of our experiences are similar and/or shared, leading to similarity of constructs with others. Discussing constructs also helps to build shared constructs.
The fragmentation corollary: Many of our constructs conflict with one another. These may be dictated by different contexts and roles.
The sociality corollary: We interact with others through understanding of their constructs.</theory:hasDescription>

The credibility of the person administering the placebo is hence another important factor, as is the manner of administration.People who are higher in ego resilience and agreeableness, and with lower angry neuroticism, tend to be more susceptible to placebos, which are reflected in their more easily forming bonds with prescribing doctors. These people also tend to have more opioid receptor activity in the brain.Alternative medicines, from acupuncture to homeopathy have been considered as working primarily (or completely) due to the placebo effect. &apos;Quack medicines&apos; peddled by charlatans depend for their success on the placebo effect.Doctors know that this often works, which is why they use it when there is no clear alternative. There is an ethical dilemma with using a placebo, as it necessarily involves deception.The placebo is by no means a cure-all and there are many diseases where it has no effect. The effect also varies with the individual, their credulity and how convinced other people they meet are that it will work.More generally, the &apos;placebo effect&apos; is also used to describe any situation where suggestion is used to some effect or where the principle of &apos;mind over body&apos; is significant.&apos;Placebo&apos; is Latin for &apos;I shall please&apos;.The &apos;nocebo effect&apos; (Latin for &apos;I will harm&apos;) is a reverse of the placebo, where interventions have a negative effect.</theory:hasDescription>

The reverse is also true, as defensive talk will threaten the positive face.Conformance to the social rules of politeness is treading a central and safe path which neither threatens nor signals that you may be threatened.Politeness means acting to help save face for others. </theory:hasDescription>

Charles Handy: Power resources (physical, financial, position, expert, personal), methods of influence (force, rules/procedures, exchange, persuasion, ecology, magnetism)
Henry Mintzberg: Resources, technical skill, knowledge, formal power and access to othersSimplifying, power comes from:Being able to do something that the other person does not want.
Having something that the other person wants (or at least controlling access to it).
Being able to change the beliefs or understanding of the other person ( through rational logic or irrational charisma). </theory:hasDescription>

Typically, primed ideas are effective for around 24 hours. Conceptual priming occurs where related ideas are used to prime the response, for example &apos;hat&apos; may prime for &apos;head&apos;.Semantic priming occurs where the meaning created influences later thoughts. Semantic and conceptual priming are very similar and the terms may be used interchangeably.Non-associative semantic priming refers to related concepts but where one is less likely to trigger thoughts of the other, for example &apos;Sun&apos; and &apos;Venus&apos;.Perceptual priming, is based on the form of the stimulus, for example where a part-picture is completed based on a picture seen earlier.Associative priming happens when a linked idea is primed, for example when &apos;bread&apos; primes the thought of &apos;butter&apos;. This particularly applies to &apos;free association&apos; word pairs.Masked priming occurs where a word or image is presented for a very short time but is not consciously recognized.Repetitive priming occurs where the repetition of something leads to it influencing later thoughts.Reverse priming occurs where people realize they are being primed and, feeling they have been biased, over-respond in their choices which are now biased in the reverse direction.</theory:hasDescription>

Demonstrating such social norms is likely to get you admiration from other people around you.Prosocial behavior varies with context as much as between people. Men will tend to be chivalrous for short periods, whilst women will work quietly for longer periods. People who are in a good mood are more likely to do good, as are people who are feeling guilty.

        <theory:hasDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">A schema is a mental structure we use to organize and simplify our knowledge of the world around us. We have schemas about ourselves, other people, mechanical devices, food, and in fact almost everything.Schemas can be related to one another, sometimes in a hierarchy (so a salesman is a man is a human). Schemas affect what we notice, how we interpret things and how we make decisions and act. They act like filters, accentuating and downplaying various elements. We use them to classify things, such as when we ‘pigeon-hole’ people. They also help us forecast, predicting what will happen. We even remember and recall things via schemas, using them to ‘encode’ memories.Schemas help us fill in the gaps. When we classify something we have observed, the schema will tell us much about its meaning and how it will behave, hence enabling threat assessment and other forecasting.Schemas appear very often in the attribution of cause. The multiple necessary cause schema is one where we require at least two causes before a ‘fit’ to the schema is declared.Once we have created or accepted a schema, we will fight hard to sustain it, for example by ignoring or force-fitting observations that do not comply with the schema. It is only after sustained contrary evidence that many of us will admit the need to change the schema.Schemas are often shared within cultures, allowing short-cut communications. Every word is, in effect, a schema, as when you read it you receive a package of additional inferred information.We tend to have favorite schema which we use often. When interpreting the world, we will try to use these first, going on to others if they do not sufficiently fit. Schemas are also self-sustaining, and will persist even in the face of disconfirming evidence. This is because if something does not match the schema, such as evidence against it, it is ignored. Some schema are easier to change than others, and some people are more open about changing any of their schemas than other people.Other types of schema include:Social schemas are about general social knowledge. 
Person schemas are about individual people. 
Idealized person schemas are called prototypes. The word is also used for any generalized schema.
Self-schemas are about oneself. We also hold idealized or projected selves, or possible selves. 
Role schemas are about proper behaviors in given situations. 
Trait schemas about the innate characteristics people have.
Event schemas (or scripts) are about what happens in specific situations.
Object schemas about inanimate things and how they work.The plural of Schema is Schemas (USA) or Schemata (UK). Schemas are also known as mental models, concepts, mental representations and knowledge structures (although definitions do vary--for example some define mental models as modeling cause-effect only).</theory:hasDescription>

In an internal PLOC a person feels they are the initiator and sustainer of their own actions.People with a higher internal PLOC thus feel self-determined in that they see their behavior as stemming from their own choices, values, and interests, whereas those with an external PLOC experience their behavior as controlled by some external event, person, or force.The internal locus is connected with intrinsic motivation, whilst the external locus is connected with extrinsic motivation.The distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic is a core part of SDT, which was developed in the wake of Behavioralism and Conditioning, where behavior management is based around reward and punishment. SDT extends this extrinsic view to consider intrinsic effects.There are three needs that SDT identifies as requiring satisfaction:Competence: succeeding in what you do.
Relatedness: connecting with others.
Autonomy: being in control of your life.</theory:hasDescription>

This is particularly true when internal cues are so weak or confusing they effectively put the person in the same position as an external observer.Self-Perception Theory provides an alternative explanation for cognitive dissonance effects. For example Festinger and Carlsmith&apos;s experiment where people were paid $1 or $20 to lie. Cognitive dissonance says that people felt bad about lying for $1 because they could not justify the act. Self-perception takes an &apos;observer&apos;s view, concluding that those who were paid $1 must have really enjoyed it (because $1 does not justify the act) whilst those who were paid $20 were just doing it for the money.Note that this indicates how changing people&apos;s attitudes happens only when two factors are present:They are aroused, feeling the discomfort of dissonance.
They attribute the cause of this to their own behaviors and attitudes.</theory:hasDescription>

The chances of having a better relationship with someone else.In deciding what is fair, we develop a comparison level against which we compare the give/take ratio. This level will vary between relationships, with some being more giving and others where we get more from the relationship. They will also vary greatly in what is given and received. Thus, for example, exchanges at home may be very different, both in balance and content.We also have a comparison level for the alternative relationships. With a high such comparison level, we might believe the world is full of lovely people just waiting to meet us.

This plays to belonging and esteem needs as we seek the approval and friendship of others. Conformity can run very deep, as we will even change our beliefs and values to be like those of our peers and admired superiors.Compliance is where a person does something that they are asked to do by another. They may choose to comply or not to comply, although the thoughts of social reward and punishment may lead them to compliance when they really do not want to comply.Obedience is different from compliance in that it is obeying an order from someone that you accept as an authority figure. In compliance, you have some choice. In obedience, you believe that you do not have a choice. Many military officers and commercial managers are interested only in obedience.</theory:hasDescription>

        <theory:hasDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Getting a glass of water is an action. Asking someone else to get you one is also an act.When we speak, our words do not have meaning in and of themselves. They are very much affected by the situation, the speaker and the listener. Thus words alone do not have a simple fixed meaning.Locutionary act: saying something (the locution) with a certain meaning in traditional sense. This may not constitute a speech act.

Illocutionary act: the performance of an act in saying something (vs. the general act of saying something).
The illocutionary force is the speaker&apos;s intent. A true &apos;speech act&apos;.
e.g. informing, ordering, warning, undertaking.

 Perlocutionary acts: Speech acts that have an effect on the feelings, thoughts or actions of either the speaker or the listener. In other words, they seek to change minds!

Unlike locutionary acts, perlocutionary acts are external to the performance.

e.g., inspiring, persuading or deterring.Two types of locutionary act are utterance acts, where something is said (or a sound is made) and which may not have any meaning, and propositional acts, where a particular reference is made. (note: acts are sometimes also called utterances - thus a perlocutionary act is the same a perlocutionary utterance).Searle (1969) identified five illocutionary/perlocutionary points:Assertives: statements may be judged true or false because they aim to describe a state of affairs in the world.
Directives: statements attempt to make the other person&apos;s actions fit the propositional content.
Commissives: statements which commit the speaker to a course of action as described by the propositional content.
Expressives: statements that express the “sincerity condition of the speech act”.
Declaratives: statements that attempt to change the world by “representing it as having been changed”.Thus pretty much all we do when we are talking is assert, direct, commiserate, express and declare. In fact we follow two types of rules:Constitutive rules or Definition rules that create or define new forms of behavior.
Regulative or Behavior rules that govern types of behavior that already exist.The meaning of an utterance is thus defined more by convention than the initiative of the reader. When we speak, we are following learned rules.Performativity occurs where the utterance of a word also enacts it (&apos;I name this ship...&apos;). It is a form of illocutionary act. This has been taken up by such as Judith Butler in feminism and has been used to indicate how pornography is less a form of speech as a performative act of sexual degradation. It is related to suture and interpellation in the way it forces a situation.</theory:hasDescription>

        <theory:hasDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Stereotypes are generalizations about a group of people whereby we attribute a defined set of characteristics to this group. These classifications can be positive or negative, such as when various nationalities are stereotyped as friendly or unfriendly.The purpose of stereotypes is to help us know how to interact with others. Each classification has associations, scripts and so on that we use to interpret what they are saying, decide if they are good or bad, and choose how to respond to them (or not).It is easier to create stereotypes when there is a clearly visible and consistent attribute that can easily be recognized. This is why people of color, police and women are so easily stereotyped.We often accept stereotypes from other people. This helps us agree on how to understand and act towards various groups of people in a consistent way.People from stereotyped groups can find this very disturbing as they experience an apprehension (stereotype threat) of being treated unfairly.We change our stereotypes infrequently. Even in the face of disconfirming evidence, we often cling to our obviously-wrong beliefs. When we do change the stereotypes, we do so in one of three ways:Bookkeeping model: As we learn new contradictory information, we incrementally adjust the stereotype to adapt to the new information. We usually need quite a lot of repeated information for each incremental change. Individual evidence is taken as the exception that proves the rule.
Conversion model: We throw away the old stereotype and start again. This is often used when there is significant disconfirming evidence.
Subtyping model: We create a new stereotype that is a sub-classification of the existing stereotype, particularly when we can draw a boundary around the sub-class. Thus if we have a stereotype for Americans, a visit to New York may result in us having a ‘New Yorkers are different’ sub-type.We often store stereotypes in two parts. First there is the generalized descriptions and attributes. To this we may add exemplars to prove the case, such as &apos;the policeman next door&apos;. We may also store them hierarchically, such as &apos;black people&apos;, &apos;Africans&apos;, &apos;Ugandans&apos;, &apos;Ugandan military&apos;, etc., with each lower order inheriting the characteristics of the higher order, with additional characteristics added.Stereotyping can go around in circles. Men stereotype women and women stereotype men. In certain societies this is intensified as the stereotyping of women pushes them together more and they create men as more of an out-group. The same thing happens with different racial groups, such as &apos;white/black&apos; (an artificial system of opposites, which in origin seems to be more like &apos;European/non-European&apos;).Stereotyping can be subconscious, where it subtly biases our decisions and actions, even in people who consciously do not want to be biased.Stereotyping often happens not so much because of aggressive or unkind thoughts. It is more often a simplification to speed conversation on what is not considered to be an important topic.</theory:hasDescription>

        <theory:hasDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">When hostages are taken, some may begin to have positive feelings towards their captors, which can include love and adoption of the captors&apos; beliefs. They may defend the captors, both verbally and even physically.The name comes from the robbery of the Kreditbanken at Norrmalmstorg in Stockholm, where bank employees were held hostage for six days in 1973. Authorities were surprised when the hostages showed attachment to their captors, even defending the captors&apos; actions. The name &apos;Stockholm Syndrome&apos; was first used by criminologist and psychiatrist Nils Bejerot, who helped the police during this period.The reasons for hostages to act this way may start with them acting in a sympathetic way in order to seek mercy from their captors. They may then change their beliefs in order sustain internal consistency between actions and beliefs. This would be supported if the captors reciprocate civil behavior.The effect may be related to fear of police action that threatens everyone, including hostages. Hostages may hence identify with captor anger at police and agree with their anger.It is also possible that those who show concern for their captors are simply displaying a common humanity where they have concern for all people. This may be triggered as a reaction against others who frame the captors as unremittingly evil. From a psychoanalytic viewpoint, it seems related to transference.The Stockholm Syndrome seems likely to take hold when people are held hostage for long periods and their fear gives way to something more tolerable. It may also be more common in people who admire strength and maybe have been influenced by a dominant father.The same effect may apply when anyone is incarcerated with others who have control over them, including abductees, prisoners, cult members, battered spouses and so on.It has been suggested that Stockholm Syndrome happens on a societal level, where a patriarchal culture leads to women bonding with dominant men.According to a 2009 FBI report, only 8% of victims develop some kind of regard for their captors. Three critical factors are also identified:A significant length of time must pass before the symptoms appear (typically several days).
The hostages and the captors must sustain human contact.
The captors must treat the hostages well, or at least not abuse or threaten them.Societal Stockholm Syndrome refers to the principle being found in general society, typically in the way women sometimes view men, and can be seen in abusive relationships where the abused person will still stand up for their abuser.The Stockholm Syndrome is also known as Survival Identification Syndrome, Common Sense Syndrome, Terror-Bonding or Traumatic Bonding.&apos;Lima Syndrome&apos; is a reverse effect, where captors feel sympathy towards their hostages. This is named after a 1966 abduction at the Japanese Embassy in Lima, Peru.</theory:hasDescription>

Verbal de-escalation: ‘I’m don’t love you any more.’
Behavioral de-escalation: Avoiding contact. Seeing them less often.
Negative identity management: ‘We each should see other people…’
Justification: ‘This relationship is not giving me what I want.’Duck shows a four phase model:Relationship phase. The relationship is fairly healthy, but dissatisfaction builds up with feelings of ‘there’s something wrong.’ Eventually The ‘I can’t stand it any more’ feelings build up to a point which catapults you into the breakdown stages.
Intrapsychic phase. Nothing much is said, but now the focus is on the faults of the other partner. Evidence is sought by which they can be blamed for any problems. When enough evidence is accumulated, the person feels justified in withdrawing.
Dyadic phase. The breakdown now comes out into the open, either with one person saying ‘I’m leaving’ or ‘I’m thinking of leaving’. Reality must now be faced by both partners and intensive discussions may ensue. The focus here is on the partnership. Eventually the pressure of ‘I really mean it’ breaks out and it becomes a public issue.
Social phase. Now the focus turns outwards to the perceptions of other people. Friends may be recruited to either camp and entire social groups may break into open battles of who is to blame and what should be done. Eventually, it becomes inevitable that the split will happen and things move on to the next phase.There can also be a fifth phase:Grave-dressing phase. The relationship now gets its official burying, with explanations all in place (true or otherwise).</theory:hasDescription>

This is our &apos;theory of mind&apos; about them (sometimes abbreviated to &apos;ToM&apos;). We even do the same to ourselves, stepping back and watching ourselves think and feel as we try to work out who we really are.In particular, we predict the intent of others, which helps us decide whether they are a threat or otherwise we should pre-emptively respond to their likely actions.It is also notable how we evaluate what others are thinking and may conclude that they are wrong (eg. with a false belief). This gives us the opportunity to either correct their thinking or take advantage of their apparent misunderstanding.This theory will be shaped by stereotypes and other simplifying schemas about people that we use, including our understanding of ourselves and our own thought processes.In the short term with strangers we use available signals, including facial expressions and other non-verbal signals. Longer-term we use our accumulated knowledge about an individual and the models we have built about them.We then often go on to assume that our guesses are true, interacting with others through our theory of mind, acting as if it were true. This can lead to all kinds of misinterpretations and misunderstanding.Done well, using theory of mind can be very helpful in working with others and enables us to better fit into a social context, even to the point of adopting the perceived thought processes of others. Done badly, it is common source of conflict. It can easily be affected by our own mental state, for example if we are angry or feeling judgemental, we will easily assume others have bad or evil intent.Children do not start out with a developed theory of mind process. This appears around the age of four and can be seen as they improve their assessments of what others will do.Empathy is similar to theory of mind but is more about understanding what others are feeling, as opposed to the theory of mind focus on thinking.</theory:hasDescription>

Attention was thus put on discovering these traits, often by studying successful leaders, but with the underlying assumption that if other people could also be found with these traits, then they, too, could also become great leaders.Stogdill (1974) identified the following traits and skills as critical to leaders. Traits	Skills

        <theory:hasDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">We are generally more optimistic than pessimistic and tend to over-estimate the probability of good things happening as compared to the chance of bad things happening.The valence of anything is the emotional charge that we feel when we think about it. This can be positive or negative emotion, which indicates positive valence or negative valence.It is natural for us to want good things and so we think more about them. The reverse is generally true when we think less of bad things. The availability that this creates when we are assigning probability tends to make good things seem more likely.Of course if people are pessimistic, then they may think bad things more likely. However, most of us, most of the time, find optimism a more effective state as it can create a self-fulfilling prophecy through the motivational effects it causes. It also likely has evolutionary benefits.Because of the bias towards optimism, being slightly pessimistic is likely to make you more realistic. People whose future is inescapable, such as those with a terminal illness can be more realistic in this way.FMRi tests have shown that optimism is related to reduced coding of undesirable information about the future in the frontal cortex that has been is sensitive to negative estimation errors.The &apos;Polyanna&apos; effect is where a person sees good in all things and is overly optimistic. Whilst some optimism can be helpful, being unremittingly positive is probably not the best survival strategy.The valence effect is sometimes also called &apos;wishful thinking&apos; or &apos;optimism bias&apos;.</theory:hasDescription>

        <theory:hasDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">We have both friends and acquaintances. Our friends are often a part of a close-knit group who largely know one another. Our acquaintances are far less likely to know one another.In terms of connection with general society and staying in touch with what is going on in the wider world, the weak ties with our acquaintances are paradoxically much more important than the inwardly-focused conversations with our closer friends. Indeed, the information we discuss with our friends often comes from wider sources.In the familiarity of strong ties we use simple restricted codes, where much is implicit and taken for granted. In communicating through the weak ties, we need more explicit elaborated codes for meaning to be fully communicated. When elaborating, we have more scope for creativity and the thought that it stimulates makes innovation more likely.The more weak ties we have, the more connected to the world we are and are more likely to receive important information about ideas, threats and opportunities in time to respond to them.Societies and social systems that have more weak ties are more likely to be dynamic and innovative. If the system is mostly made up of strong ties, then it will be fragmented and uncoordinated.Some weak ties are better than others. Weak ties to friends of your friends are not as useful as weak ties elsewhere as the information and further connections are likely to be similar to those of your friends. Weak ties that join separate social groups are called bridges.You can also find absent ties, where you might expect a tie but it does not exist, for example in a group of friends where two people are still distant from one another.As there are usually more people in lower classes, they have greater choice of friends and greater chance of finding similar &apos;people like me&apos; and so compensate by having more strong ties. Economic uncertainty also leads to the search for contingencies and poorer people invest far more in building multiple strong ties who will directly help them if they are in difficulty. However this may serve to anchor their status further and reduce the chance of upward social mobility.Upper class people are more relaxed about weak ties and so tend to have more. However, they have to resort to expensive clubs and other filtering mechanisms to find &apos;people like them&apos; with whom they can build stronger ties.The modern approach to business networking is based on the principle of weak ties: having a wide range of acquaintances can be far more helpful than having just a few good friends. Weak ties are also useful for activists who need to mobilize large protest or action groups.Weak ties are the channels of culture and are woven into successful organisations where many know many others on first-name terms. Three types of weak ties that may be found in towns and cities are social (casual friendship), community (eg. neighbors) and profesional (job-related).</theory:hasDescription>

Getting them to focus first on team or organizational goals, rather than their own interests.
Activating their higher-order needs.Charisma is seen as necessary, but not sufficient, for example in the way that charismatic movie stars may not make good leaders. Two key charismatic effects that transformational leaders achieve is to evoke strong emotions and to cause identification of the followers with the leader. This may be through stirring appeals. It may also may occur through quieter methods such as coaching and mentoring.Bass has recently noted that authentic transformational leadership is grounded in moral foundations that are based on four components:Idealized influence
Inspirational motivation
Intellectual stimulation
Individualized consideration...and three moral aspects:The moral character of the leader.
The ethical values embedded in the leader’s vision, articulation, and program (which followers either embrace or reject).
The morality of the processes of social ethical choice and action that leaders and followers engage in and collectively pursue.This is in contrast with pseudo-transformational leadership, where, for example, in-group/out-group &apos;us and them&apos; games are used to bond followers to the leader.</theory:hasDescription>

In doing so, they may model the values themselves and use charismatic methods to attract people to the values and to the leader.Burns&apos; view is that transformational leadership is more effective than transactional leadership, where the appeal is to more selfish concerns. An appeal to social values thus encourages people to collaborate, rather than working as individuals (and potentially competitively with one another). He also views transformational leadership as an ongoing process rather than the discrete exchanges of the transactional approach.</theory:hasDescription>

A high LPC leader generally scores the other person as positive and a low LPC leader scores them as negative.High LPC leaders tend to have close and positive relationships and act in a supportive way, even prioritizing the relationship before the task. Low LPC leaders put the task first and will turn to relationships only when they are satisfied with how the work is going.Three factors are then identified about the leader, member and the task, as follows:Leader-Member Relations: The extent to which the leader has the support and loyalties of followers and relations with them are friendly and cooperative.
Task structure: The extent to which tasks are standardised, documented and controlled.
Leader&apos;s Position-power: The extent to which the leader has authority to assess follower performance and give reward or punishment.The best LPC approach depends on a combination of there three. Generally, a high LPC approach is best when leader-member relations are poor, except when the task is unstructured and the leader is weak, in which a low LPC style is better. #	Leader-Member Relations	Task structure	Leader&apos;s Position- power	Most Effective leader

This is to misunderstand the law of large numbers, where a large number of random events, such as coin tossing, will closely approach the natural distribution (eg. 50% heads and 50% tails).A critical element of the fallacy is that wins and losses will balance themselves out in the short term, rather than the long term, such that several losses means wins are more likely. The truth is when the driver is random chance, the probability of winning or losing is always the same each time.This fallacy can appear as a contradiction to the Hot Hand Phenomenon, where a run of success is assumed to continue.In the more general description of the gambler&apos;s fallacy, it includes the assumption of a run of luck or &apos;winning streak&apos;, where because I have won several times I feel I am more likely to continue winning.Other false predictions around luck include assumptions of luck running out and being on a losing streak.Generally we all need to explain our experiences (as in attribution theory) and gamblers are no different. They thus form theories about why they are winning or losing based on luck and their own skill. Recency and availability effects also have an impact on predictions.</theory:hasDescription>

        <theory:hasDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The Path-Goal Theory of Leadership was developed to describe the way that leaders encourage and support their followers in achieving the goals they have been set by making the path that they should take clear and easy.In particular, leaders:Clarify the path so subordinates know which way to go.
Remove roadblocks that are stopping them going there.
Increasing the rewards along the route.Leaders can take a strong or limited approach in these. In clarifying the path, they may be directive or give vague hints. In removing roadblocks, they may scour the path or help the follower move the bigger blocks. In increasing rewards, they may give occasional encouragement or pave the way with gold.This variation in approach will depend on the situation, including the follower&apos;s capability and motivation, as well as the difficulty of the job and other contextual factors.House and Mitchell (1974) describe four styles of leadership:Supportive leadershipConsidering the needs of the follower, showing concern for their welfare and creating a friendly working environment. This includes increasing the follower&apos;s self-esteem and making the job more interesting. This approach is best when the work is stressful, boring or hazardous.Directive leadershipTelling followers what needs to be done and giving appropriate guidance along the way. This includes giving them schedules of specific work to be done at specific times. Rewards may also be increased as needed and role ambiguity decreased (by telling them what they should be doing).This may be used when the task is unstructured and complex and the follower is inexperienced. This increases the follower&apos;s sense of security and control and hence is appropriate to the situation.Participative leadershipConsulting with followers and taking their ideas into account when making decisions and taking particular actions. This approach is best when the followers are expert and their advice is both needed and they expect to be able to give it.Achievement-oriented leadershipSetting challenging goals, both in work and in self-improvement (and often together). High standards are demonstrated and expected. The leader shows faith in the capabilities of the follower to succeed. This approach is best when the task is complex.</theory:hasDescription>

        <theory:hasDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Leader-Member Exchange Theory, also called LMX or Vertical Dyad Linkage Theory, describes how leaders in groups maintain their position through a series of tacit exchange agreements with their members.In-group and out-groupIn particular, leaders often have a special relationship with an inner circle of trusted lieutenants, assistants and advisors, to whom they give high levels of responsibility, decision influence, and access to resources. This in-group pay for their position. They work harder, are more committed to task objectives, and share more administrative duties. They are also expected to be fully committed and loyal to their leader. The out-group, on the other hand, are given low levels of choice or influence.This also puts constraints upon the leader. They have to nurture the relationship with their inner circle whilst balancing giving them power with ensuring they do not have enough to strike out on their own.The LMX processThese relationships, if they are going to happen, start very soon after a person joins the group and follow three stages.1. Role takingThe member joins the team and the leader assesses their abilities and talents. Based on this, the leader may offer them opportunities to demonstrate their capabilities.Another key factor in this stage is the discovery by both parties of how the other likes to be respected.2. Role makingIn the second phase, the leader and member take part in an unstructured and informal negotiation whereby a role is created for the member and the often-tacit promise of benefit and power in return for dedication and loyalty takes place.Trust-building is very important in this stage, and any felt betrayal, especially by the leader, can result in the member being relegated to the out-group.This negotiation includes relationship factors as well as pure work-related ones, and a member who is similar to the leader in various ways is more likely to succeed. This perhaps explains why mixed gender relationships regularly are less successful than same-gender ones (it also affects the seeking of respect in the first stage). The same effect also applies to cultural and racial differences.3. RoutinizationIn this phase, a pattern of ongoing social exchange between the leader and the member becomes established.Success factorsSuccessful members are thus similar in many ways to the leader (which perhaps explains why many senior teams are all white, male, middle-class and middle-aged). They work hard at building and sustaining trust and respect.To help this, they are empathetic, patient, reasonable, sensitive, and are good at seeing the viewpoint of other people (especially the leader). Aggression, sarcasm and an egocentric view are keys to the out-group wash-room.The overall quality of the LMX relationship varies with several factors. Curiously, it is better when the challenge of the job is extremely high or extremely low. The size of the group, financial resource availability and the overall workload are also important.Onwards and upwardsThe principle works upwards as well. The leader also gains power by being a member of their manager&apos;s inner circle, which then can then share on downwards. People at the bottom of an organization with unusual power may get it from an unbroken chain of circles up to the hierarchy.</theory:hasDescription>

        <theory:hasDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Kurt Lewin and colleagues did leadership decision experiments in 1939 and identified three different styles of leadership, in particular around decision-making.AutocraticIn the autocratic style, the leader takes decisions without consulting with others. The decision is made without any form of consultation. In Lewin&apos;s experiments, he found that this caused the most level of discontent.An autocratic style works when there is no need for input on the decision, where the decision would not change as a result of input, and where the motivation of people to carry out subsequent actions would not be affected whether they were or were not involved in the decision-making.DemocraticIn the democratic style, the leader involves the people in the decision-making, although the process for the final decision may vary from the leader having the final say to them facilitating consensus in the group.Democratic decision-making is usually appreciated by the people, especially if they have been used to autocratic decisions with which they disagreed. It can be problematic when there are a wide range of opinions and there is no clear way of reaching an equitable final decision.Laissez-FaireThe laissez-faire style is to minimize the leader&apos;s involvement in decision-making, and hence allowing people to make their own decisions, although they may still be responsible for the outcome.Laissez-faire works best when people are capable and motivated in making their own decisions, and where there is no requirement for a central coordination, for example in sharing resources across a range of different people and groups.</theory:hasDescription>

Communication is almost entirely downwards and the psychologically distant concerns of people are ignored.Benevolent authoritativeWhen the leader adds concern for people to an authoritative position, a &apos;benevolent dictatorship&apos; is formed. The leader now uses rewards to encourage appropriate performance and listens more to concerns lower down the organization, although what they hear is often rose-tinted, being limited to what their subordinates think that the boss wants to hear. Although there may be some delegation of decisions, almost all major decisions are still made centrally.ConsultativeThe upward flow of information here is still cautious and rose-tinted to some degree, although the leader is making genuine efforts to listen carefully to ideas. Nevertheless, major decisions are still largely centrally made.ParticipativeAt this level, the leader makes maximum use of participative methods, engaging people lower down the organization in decision-making. People across the organization are psychologically closer together and work well together at all levels.</theory:hasDescription>

        <theory:hasDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Decision quality is the selection of the best alternative, and is particularly important when there are many alternatives. It is also important when there are  serious implications for selecting (or failing to select) the best alternative.Decision acceptance is the degree to which a follower accepts a decision made by a leader. Leaders focus more on decision acceptance when decision quality is more important.Vroom and Yetton defined five different decision procedures. Two are autocratic (A1 and A2), two are consultative (C1 and C2) and one is Group based (G2).A1: Leader takes known information and then decides alone.A2: Leader gets information from followers, and then decides alone.C1: Leader shares problem with followers individually, listens to ideas and then decides alone.C2: Leader shares problems with followers as a group, listens to ideas and then decides alone.G2: Leader shares problems with followers as a group and then seeks and accepts consensus agreement. Situational factors that influence the method are relatively logical:When decision quality is important and followers possess useful information, then A1 and A2 are not the best method.
When the leader sees decision quality as important but followers do not, then G2 is inappropriate.
When decision quality is important, when the problem is unstructured and the leader lacks information / skill to make the decision alone, then G2 is best.
When decision acceptance is important and followers are unlikely to accept an autocratic decision, then A1 and A2 are inappropriate.
when decision acceptance is important but followers are likely to disagree with one another, then A1, A2 and C1 are not appropriate, because they do not give opportunity for differences to be resolved.
When decision quality is not important but decision acceptance is critical, then G2 is the best method.
When decision quality is important, all agree with this, and the decision is not likely to result from an autocratic decision then G2 is best.</theory:hasDescription>
