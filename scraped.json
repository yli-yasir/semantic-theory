We have an upper limit to activation, beyond which we become overly stressed and fall into satisficing.People will seek activation through different types of stimulation, including novelty, complexity, variation and uncertainty. At a low level of activation, performance is decreased due to three factors:A lack of alertness\nDulling of the senses\nLimited muscular coordinationThese in turn can lead to increased error or accident, and slower completion of tasks.

When we have erred, we will more likely use external attribution, attributing causes to situational factors rather than blaming ourselves. And vice versa. We will attribute our successes internally and the successes of our rivals to external ‘luck’. When a football team wins, supporters say ‘we won’. But when the team loses, the supporters say ‘they lost’.Our attributions are also significantly driven by our emotional and motivational drives. Blaming other people and avoiding personal recrimination are very real self-serving attributions. We will also make attributions to defend what we perceive as attacks. We will point to injustice in an unfair world. People with a high need to avoid failure will have a greater tendency to make attributions that put themselves in a good light.We will even tend to blame victims (of us and of others) for their fate as we seek to distance ourselves from thoughts of suffering the same plight.We will also tend to ascribe less variability to other people than ourselves, seeing ourselves as more multifaceted and less predictable than others. This may well because we can see more of what is inside ourselves (and spend more time doing this).In practice, we often tend to go through a two-step process, starting with an automatic internal attribution, followed by a slower consideration of whether an external attribution is more appropriate.

If I believe I am good but do something bad, then the discomfort I feel as a result is cognitive dissonance.Cognitive dissonance is a very powerful motivator which will often lead us to change one or other of the conflicting belief or action. The discomfort often feels like a tension between the two opposing thoughts. To release the tension we can take one of three actions:Change our behavior.\nJustify our behavior by changing the conflicting cognition.\nJustify our behavior by adding new cognitions.Dissonance is most powerful when it is about our self-image. Feelings of foolishness, immorality and so on (including internal projections during decision-making) are dissonance in action.If an action has been completed and cannot be undone, then the after-the-fact dissonance compels us to change our beliefs. If beliefs are moved, then the dissonance appears during decision-making, forcing us to take actions we would not have taken before.Cognitive dissonance appears in virtually all evaluations and decisions and is the central mechanism by which we experience new differences in the world. When we see other people behave differently to our images of them, when we hold any conflicting thoughts, we experience dissonance.Dissonance increases with the importance and impact of the decision, along with the difficulty of reversing it.

If I am being rewarded extrinsically for doing it, then I can explain to myself that I am doing it for the reward. In this way, rewards can decrease internal motivation as people work to gain the reward rather than because they like doing the work or believe it is a good thing to do.In effect, extrinsic motivations can change a pleasurable into work.There are three primary types of extrinsic motivation, as in the table below: Motivation\tBehavior sustained by...\tExample\nExternal motivation\t...environmental reward or punishment contingencies.\tDo work because paid to do it.\nIntrojected motivation\t...desire to avoid internally imposed guilt and recrimination.\tDo work to earn money to sustain family.\nIdentified motivation\t...desire to express important self-identifications.\tDo work because it is 'what I want to do'.\n\n \n\nIn addition, a fourth type of extrinsic motivation, integrated regulation, has been described.

We find feedback (if it is sympathetically done) very encouraging and motivating. This includes feedback from ourselves. Negative self-talk is just as demotivating as negative comments from other people.Directional and accuracy goalsDepending on the type of goal we have, we will go about achieving it differently.A directional goal is one where we are motivated to arrive at a particular conclusion. We will thus narrow our thinking, selecting beliefs, etc. that support the conclusion. The lack of deliberation also tends to make us more optimistic about achieving the goal.An accuracy goal is one where we are motivated to arrive at the most accurate possible conclusion. These occur when the cost of being inaccurate is high. Unsurprisingly, people invest more effort in achieving accuracy goals, as any deviation costs, and a large deviation may well more. Their deliberation also makes them realize that there is a real chance that they will not achieve their goal.

          "description": "Optimism bias is the tendency to believe that we are more likely to be successful, and otherwise experience good things, than actual probabilities predict. In particular, we tend to be more optimistic about our own chances than we do about other people.Optimism bias can be assessed by asking people how likely they are to fail or experience something negative as compared with others. Many of us think they will face less risk and negative outcomes than others.With regard to emotion, being optimistic makes us feel better for longer. When we believe we will benefit from a future event, we feel good about this as we think of ourselves in that situation and feel anticipatory pleasure. Even if the event does not happen, we only feel bad at that time and can easily move on to other positive thinking, such as when we tell ourselves 'It'll be better next time'.There are evolutionary benefits for optimism. Optimistic people will try more things that those who are more cautious. Certainly, over-optimism can lead to at best a waste of time and at worst loss of life. Yet even this helps evolution of people who have the right amount of optimism. Overall, optimism and consequent experimentation leads to learning and that some people, at least, will make breakthroughs that would not be achieved if we were all more realistic. This spreads beyond humans as animals will also display optimism.Optimism is affected by temperament, where some people are generally more optimistic than others. It is also affected by shorter-term mood, for example a person who is feeling depressed is less likely to be optimistic. Indeed, those who are depressed or who are generally in a negative frame of mind may tend towards an opposite, pessimistic bias. Optimism is also moderated by caution and the desire to avoid or reduce risks.Selective memory tends to affect optimism when we recall past successes and positive events more easily than negative ones (which we may ignore or suppress).Other factors that affect optimism include:The degree of control a person believes they have.\nThe amount of support they person thinks they have from other people.\nThe successes the person has had in the past.\nWhere action is necessary and caution is not likely to be helpful.\nTendency towards self-confidence, arrogance and other thoughts that create cognitive self-bias.\nThe perceived probability and impact of the desired event.\nThe perceived probability and impact of negative events should the desired event not occur.\nThe extent to which we have told other people we will succeed.Optimism is also encouraged within many cultures, where being positive receives more desirable feedback and being negative leads to criticism or less desirable feedback. In other words, we prefer people who are optimistic. Even when we know they are probably wrong, cheerful people who think the future will be good make us feel happier.",

There may also be some conditioning effect. The credibility of the person administering the placebo is hence another important factor, as is the manner of administration.People who are higher in ego resilience and agreeableness, and with lower angry neuroticism, tend to be more susceptible to placebos, which are reflected in their more easily forming bonds with prescribing doctors. These people also tend to have more opioid receptor activity in the brain.Alternative medicines, from acupuncture to homeopathy have been considered as working primarily (or completely) due to the placebo effect. 'Quack medicines' peddled by charlatans depend for their success on the placebo effect.Doctors know that this often works, which is why they use it when there is no clear alternative. There is an ethical dilemma with using a placebo, as it necessarily involves deception.The placebo is by no means a cure-all and there are many diseases where it has no effect. The effect also varies with the individual, their credulity and how convinced other people they meet are that it will work.More generally, the 'placebo effect' is also used to describe any situation where suggestion is used to some effect or where the principle of 'mind over body' is significant.'Placebo' is Latin for 'I shall please'.The 'nocebo effect' (Latin for 'I will harm') is a reverse of the placebo, where interventions have a negative effect.",

Positive psychology is about our strengths rather than our weaknesses. It is about:A pleasant life: seeking success and positive emotions of past, present and future.\nA good life: building major life themes such as in work, love, and family living.\nA meaningful life: serving a greater cause or belief beyond our immediate needs.Interestingly, positive emotions all feel pretty similar, yet negative emotions such as fear, anger, disgust and sadness each have quite unique feelings.

There may also be some conditioning effect. The credibility of the person administering the placebo is hence another important factor, as is the manner of administration.People who are higher in ego resilience and agreeableness, and with lower angry neuroticism, tend to be more susceptible to placebos, which are reflected in their more easily forming bonds with prescribing doctors. These people also tend to have more opioid receptor activity in the brain.Alternative medicines, from acupuncture to homeopathy have been considered as working primarily (or completely) due to the placebo effect. 'Quack medicines' peddled by charlatans depend for their success on the placebo effect.Doctors know that this often works, which is why they use it when there is no clear alternative. There is an ethical dilemma with using a placebo, as it necessarily involves deception.The placebo is by no means a cure-all and there are many diseases where it has no effect. The effect also varies with the individual, their credulity and how convinced other people they meet are that it will work.More generally, the 'placebo effect' is also used to describe any situation where suggestion is used to some effect or where the principle of 'mind over body' is significant.'Placebo' is Latin for 'I shall please'.The 'nocebo effect' (Latin for 'I will harm') is a reverse of the placebo, where interventions have a negative effect.",

To agree with an opponent on a small point may seem to be a slippery slope and confuse one's clarity.In arguing, many people like clear positions, where they are 'good' and the other person is 'bad'. This means that any agreement at all is hazardous as it makes oneself bad in any area of overlap. It may also seem as if the other person is trying to 'seduce me to the dark side' (so causing further retreat).The easiest approach in such cases is to take an extreme position and/or push your opponent to the opposite extreme.When the two opponents are in the same place together, the effect can be exacerbated as each seeks to avoid losing face and is constantly reminded of their differences by the presence of the other.

We have schemas about ourselves, other people, mechanical devices, food, and in fact almost everything.Schemas can be related to one another, sometimes in a hierarchy (so a salesman is a man is a human). Schemas affect what we notice, how we interpret things and how we make decisions and act. They act like filters, accentuating and downplaying various elements. We use them to classify things, such as when we ‘pigeon-hole’ people. They also help us forecast, predicting what will happen. We even remember and recall things via schemas, using them to ‘encode’ memories.Schemas help us fill in the gaps. When we classify something we have observed, the schema will tell us much about its meaning and how it will behave, hence enabling threat assessment and other forecasting.Schemas appear very often in the attribution of cause. The multiple necessary cause schema is one where we require at least two causes before a ‘fit’ to the schema is declared.Once we have created or accepted a schema, we will fight hard to sustain it, for example by ignoring or force-fitting observations that do not comply with the schema. It is only after sustained contrary evidence that many of us will admit the need to change the schema.Schemas are often shared within cultures, allowing short-cut communications. Every word is, in effect, a schema, as when you read it you receive a package of additional inferred information.We tend to have favorite schema which we use often. When interpreting the world, we will try to use these first, going on to others if they do not sufficiently fit. Schemas are also self-sustaining, and will persist even in the face of disconfirming evidence. This is because if something does not match the schema, such as evidence against it, it is ignored. Some schema are easier to change than others, and some people are more open about changing any of their schemas than other people.Other types of schema include:Social schemas are about general social knowledge. \nPerson schemas are about individual people. \nIdealized person schemas are called prototypes. The word is also used for any generalized schema.\nSelf-schemas are about oneself. We also hold idealized or projected selves, or possible selves. \nRole schemas are about proper behaviors in given situations. \nTrait schemas about the innate characteristics people have.\nEvent schemas (or scripts) are about what happens in specific situations.\nObject schemas about inanimate things and how they work.The plural of Schema is Schemas (USA) or Schemata (UK). Schemas are also known as mental models, concepts, mental representations and knowledge structures (although definitions do vary--for example some define mental models as modeling cause-effect only).",

When we have erred, we will more likely use external attribution, attributing causes to situational factors rather than blaming ourselves. And vice versa. We will attribute our successes internally and the successes of our rivals to external ‘luck’. When a football team wins, supporters say ‘we won’. But when the team loses, the supporters say ‘they lost’.Our attributions are also significantly driven by our emotional and motivational drives. Blaming other people and avoiding personal recrimination are very real self-serving attributions. We will also make attributions to defend what we perceive as attacks. We will point to injustice in an unfair world. People with a high need to avoid failure will have a greater tendency to make attributions that put themselves in a good light.We will even tend to blame victims (of us and of others) for their fate as we seek to distance ourselves from thoughts of suffering the same plight.We will also tend to ascribe less variability to other people than ourselves, seeing ourselves as more multifaceted and less predictable than others. This may well because we can see more of what is inside ourselves (and spend more time doing this).In practice, we often tend to go through a two-step process, starting with an automatic internal attribution, followed by a slower consideration of whether an external attribution is more appropriate.

          "description": "People develop internal models of reality, called constructs in order to understand and explain the world around them in the same way that scientists develop theories. Like scientists, they develop these constructs based on observation and experimentation. Constructs thus start as unstable conjecture, changing and stabilizing as more experience and proof is gained.Constructs are often defined by words, but can also be non-verbal and hard to explain, such as the feeling you get when your football team just won the championship.When constructs are challenged or incomplete the result is emotional states such as anxiety, confusion, anger and fear.Constructs are often polar in that they have opposites (and are hence dichotomous). Thus the construct of good implies another of bad. Polar constructs create one another: thus 'good' cannot exist without 'bad'. When poles are denied, they are said to be submerged.Although we share the idea of constructs through words, the detail of constructs are particular to the individual and hence are called personal constructs.Constructs that are important to the person are core constructs, whilst others are called peripheral constructs.Constructs may be expanded (dilated) to accommodate new ideas or constricted to become more specific.Kelly's (1955) basic postulate is that 'A person's processes are psychologically channelized by the ways in which he anticipates events'. He followed this with eleven corollaries.The construction corollary: We conservatively construct anticipation based on past experiences.\nThe experience corollary: When things do not happen as expected, we change our constructs (thus reconstructing). This changes our future expectations.\nThe dichotomy corollary: We store experience as constructs, and then look at the world through them.\nThe organizational corollary: Constructs are connected to one another in hierarchies and network of relationships. These relationships may be loose or tight.\nThe range corollary: Constructs are useful only in limited range of situations. Some ranges are broad, whilst other ranges are narrow.\nThe modulation corollary: Some construct ranges can be 'modulated' to accommodate new ideas (e.g. 'big'). Others are 'impermeable'.\n The choice corollary: We can choose to gain new experiences to expand our constructs or stay in the safe but limiting zone of current constructs.\nThe individuality corollary: As everyone's experience is different, their constructs are different.\nThe commonality corollary: Many of our experiences are similar and/or shared, leading to similarity of constructs with others. Discussing constructs also helps to build shared constructs.\nThe fragmentation corollary: Many of our constructs conflict with one another. These may be dictated by different contexts and roles.\nThe sociality corollary: We interact with others through understanding of their constructs.",

After writing about such as learned helplessness, Martin Seligman made the brilliant observation that the positive experience was an almost completely unexplored field. Positive psychology is about our strengths rather than our weaknesses. It is about:A pleasant life: seeking success and positive emotions of past, present and future.\nA good life: building major life themes such as in work, love, and family living.\nA meaningful life: serving a greater cause or belief beyond our immediate needs.Interestingly, positive emotions all feel pretty similar, yet negative emotions such as fear, anger, disgust and sadness each have quite unique feelings.

          "description": "A schema is a mental structure we use to organize and simplify our knowledge of the world around us. We have schemas about ourselves, other people, mechanical devices, food, and in fact almost everything.Schemas can be related to one another, sometimes in a hierarchy (so a salesman is a man is a human). Schemas affect what we notice, how we interpret things and how we make decisions and act. They act like filters, accentuating and downplaying various elements. We use them to classify things, such as when we ‘pigeon-hole’ people. They also help us forecast, predicting what will happen. We even remember and recall things via schemas, using them to ‘encode’ memories.Schemas help us fill in the gaps. When we classify something we have observed, the schema will tell us much about its meaning and how it will behave, hence enabling threat assessment and other forecasting.Schemas appear very often in the attribution of cause. The multiple necessary cause schema is one where we require at least two causes before a ‘fit’ to the schema is declared.Once we have created or accepted a schema, we will fight hard to sustain it, for example by ignoring or force-fitting observations that do not comply with the schema. It is only after sustained contrary evidence that many of us will admit the need to change the schema.Schemas are often shared within cultures, allowing short-cut communications. Every word is, in effect, a schema, as when you read it you receive a package of additional inferred information.We tend to have favorite schema which we use often. When interpreting the world, we will try to use these first, going on to others if they do not sufficiently fit. Schemas are also self-sustaining, and will persist even in the face of disconfirming evidence. This is because if something does not match the schema, such as evidence against it, it is ignored. Some schema are easier to change than others, and some people are more open about changing any of their schemas than other people.Other types of schema include:Social schemas are about general social knowledge. \nPerson schemas are about individual people. \nIdealized person schemas are called prototypes. The word is also used for any generalized schema.\nSelf-schemas are about oneself. We also hold idealized or projected selves, or possible selves. \nRole schemas are about proper behaviors in given situations. \nTrait schemas about the innate characteristics people have.\nEvent schemas (or scripts) are about what happens in specific situations.\nObject schemas about inanimate things and how they work.The plural of Schema is Schemas (USA) or Schemata (UK). Schemas are also known as mental models, concepts, mental representations and knowledge structures (although definitions do vary--for example some define mental models as modeling cause-effect only).",

They are very much affected by the situation, the speaker and the listener. Thus words alone do not have a simple fixed meaning.Locutionary act: saying something (the locution) with a certain meaning in traditional sense. This may not constitute a speech act.\n\nIllocutionary act: the performance of an act in saying something (vs. the general act of saying something).\nThe illocutionary force is the speaker's intent. A true 'speech act'.\ne.g. informing, ordering, warning, undertaking.\n\n Perlocutionary acts: Speech acts that have an effect on the feelings, thoughts or actions of either the speaker or the listener. In other words, they seek to change minds!\n\nUnlike locutionary acts, perlocutionary acts are external to the performance.\n\ne.g., inspiring, persuading or deterring.Two types of locutionary act are utterance acts, where something is said (or a sound is made) and which may not have any meaning, and propositional acts, where a particular reference is made. (note: acts are sometimes also called utterances - thus a perlocutionary act is the same a perlocutionary utterance).Searle (1969) identified five illocutionary/perlocutionary points:Assertives: statements may be judged true or false because they aim to describe a state of affairs in the world.\nDirectives: statements attempt to make the other person's actions fit the propositional content.\nCommissives: statements which commit the speaker to a course of action as described by the propositional content.\nExpressives: statements that express the “sincerity condition of the speech act”.\nDeclaratives: statements that attempt to change the world by “representing it as having been changed”.Thus pretty much all we do when we are talking is assert, direct, commiserate, express and declare. In fact we follow two types of rules:Constitutive rules or Definition rules that create or define new forms of behavior.\nRegulative or Behavior rules that govern types of behavior that already exist.The meaning of an utterance is thus defined more by convention than the initiative of the reader. When we speak, we are following learned rules.Performativity occurs where the utterance of a word also enacts it ('I name this ship...'). It is a form of illocutionary act. This has been taken up by such as Judith Butler in feminism and has been used to indicate how pornography is less a form of speech as a performative act of sexual degradation.

When we think of the past or future we hence may feel good or bad about it.Primary appraisal is an assessment of how significant an event is for a person, including whether it is a threat or opportunity. Secondary appraisal then considers one's ability to cope or take advantage of the situation.A structural model of appraisal describes the relationships between:Perception: The environment and the person's perception of this\nAppraisal: The person's appraisal processes that evaluate the perceived environment in terms of values on a set of measures called appraisal dimensions.\nMediation: The processes that relate appraisal values to the person's emotions.A process model of appraisal describes the detail of cognitive operations, mechanisms and dynamics by which the appraisal happens. In other words, the structural model is the static map and the process model is the dynamic operation.This is a cognitive approach to understanding emotions. Other theories view emotion as more reactive, without the opportunity to think. Indeed, we sometimes do not get the chance to think, for example when a fierce creature leaps out at us and we react with animal instinct that short-circuits the slower cortical appraisal. However, such reactive emotion is not necessarily how we feel in all situations.Originated in the 1940s by Magda Arnold, research was taken up in the 1970s by Richard Lazarus.Appraisal Theory is a Cognitive Appraisal Theory.

Emotions grab our attention and at least attenuate slower cognitive processing.This is not a new theory and was proposed in 1884. It combined the ideas of William James and Danish physiologist Carl Lange, who largely independently arrived at the same conclusion. William James described it thus:\"My theory ... is that the bodily changes follow directly the perception of the exciting fact, and that our feeling of the same changes as they occur is the emotion. Common sense says, we lose our fortune, are sorry and weep; we meet a bear, are frightened and run; we are insulted by a rival, and angry and strike. The hypothesis here to be defended says that this order of sequence is incorrect ... and that the more rational statement is that we feel sorry because we cry, angry because we strike, afraid because we tremble ... Without the bodily states following on the perception, the latter would be purely cognitive in form, pale, colorless, destitute of emotional warmth. We might then see the bear, and judge it best to run, receive the insult and deem it right to strike, but we should not actually feel afraid or angry\"Lange particularly added that vasomotor changes are the emotions.It was largely supplanted by the Cannon-Bard theory, but of late, it has made something of a come-back, although the notion of causality is not as strong and there is ongoing uncertainty as to the chicken-and-egg question of which comes first, physiological and emotional feelings.",

Thus we don’t just feel angry, happy or whatever: we experience feeling and then decide what they mean.The sequence thus is as follows:Event ==> arousal ==> reasoning ==> emotionThis is notable as it places emotion as a cognitive act (albeit subconscious) rather than a deeper state (this is the place of arousal).",

          "description": "A schema is a mental structure we use to organize and simplify our knowledge of the world around us. We have schemas about ourselves, other people, mechanical devices, food, and in fact almost everything.Schemas can be related to one another, sometimes in a hierarchy (so a salesman is a man is a human). Schemas affect what we notice, how we interpret things and how we make decisions and act. They act like filters, accentuating and downplaying various elements. We use them to classify things, such as when we ‘pigeon-hole’ people. They also help us forecast, predicting what will happen. We even remember and recall things via schemas, using them to ‘encode’ memories.Schemas help us fill in the gaps. When we classify something we have observed, the schema will tell us much about its meaning and how it will behave, hence enabling threat assessment and other forecasting.Schemas appear very often in the attribution of cause. The multiple necessary cause schema is one where we require at least two causes before a ‘fit’ to the schema is declared.Once we have created or accepted a schema, we will fight hard to sustain it, for example by ignoring or force-fitting observations that do not comply with the schema. It is only after sustained contrary evidence that many of us will admit the need to change the schema.Schemas are often shared within cultures, allowing short-cut communications. Every word is, in effect, a schema, as when you read it you receive a package of additional inferred information.We tend to have favorite schema which we use often. When interpreting the world, we will try to use these first, going on to others if they do not sufficiently fit. Schemas are also self-sustaining, and will persist even in the face of disconfirming evidence. This is because if something does not match the schema, such as evidence against it, it is ignored. Some schema are easier to change than others, and some people are more open about changing any of their schemas than other people.Other types of schema include:Social schemas are about general social knowledge. \nPerson schemas are about individual people. \nIdealized person schemas are called prototypes. The word is also used for any generalized schema.\nSelf-schemas are about oneself. We also hold idealized or projected selves, or possible selves. \nRole schemas are about proper behaviors in given situations. \nTrait schemas about the innate characteristics people have.\nEvent schemas (or scripts) are about what happens in specific situations.\nObject schemas about inanimate things and how they work.The plural of Schema is Schemas (USA) or Schemata (UK). Schemas are also known as mental models, concepts, mental representations and knowledge structures (although definitions do vary--for example some define mental models as modeling cause-effect only).",

This is an extreme example, but it does highlight the effect. When the item in question stands out less, the likelihood of it being remembered also decreases.",
          "discussion": "The Von Restorff effect was identified by Hedwig von Restorff in 1933. She conducted a set of memory experiments around isolated and distinctive items, concluding that an isolated item, in a list of otherwise similar items, would be better remembered than an item in the same relative position in a list where all items were similar.There can also be a reverse effect here. You remember the unique item, but the attention that it grabs from you is removed from other items -- thus you may in fact remember less overall.Hedwig's work relates to Gestalt, where she related it to the Figure and Ground principles.Taylor & Fiske, (1978) indicated that attention is usually captured by salient, novel, surprising, or distinctive stimuli. These may be used to enhance the von Restorff effect.In the 'attention age', when the plethora of media around us is constantly battling for a moment of our time, advertisers make much use of this principle, each vying with the other to stand out from the crowd and hence be remembered by the target audience.The Von Restorff effect is also called the Isolation Effect or the Distinctiveness Principle (Nelson, 1979). The same principle has also been described as prominence effects (Gardner, 1983) environmental salience effects (Taylor & Fiske, 1978), and novel popout effect (Johnson, Hawley, Plewe, Elliott, & De Witt, 1990).So what?If you want people to remember something, make it stand out.

If the mother does not feel attached then the infant will not show secure attachment behavior.Note that two-way attachment is not the same as one-way dependency. An affectional bond may be one-way (eg. child to parent figure) or two-way (eg. a married couple) and leads to the person seeking to be physically close to the particular person to which they are attached. If they are separated, the person feels sadness and distress.As children develop, so does their motivational style going from fixed action patterns to to complex plan hierarchies with various sub-goals and ongoing goal correction.Perhaps unsurprisingly, Bowlby studied both attachment and loss, as the breaking of an attachment leads to a reversal in an equivalent sense of loss, which can have a deeply depressive effect.",

When the behavior is not what we would have forecast, we assume that it is due to their internal preferences or character traits.Information about five factors is sought to make these inferences:Whether the behavior being considered is voluntary and freely chosen.\nWhat is unexpected about the behavior (‘non-common effects’).\nWhether the behavior is socially desirable.\nWhether the behavior impacts the person doing the inferring (‘hedonic relevance’).\nWhether the behavior is of personal interest to the person doing the inferring (‘personalism’).",

If I believe I am good but do something bad, then the discomfort I feel as a result is cognitive dissonance.Cognitive dissonance is a very powerful motivator which will often lead us to change one or other of the conflicting belief or action. The discomfort often feels like a tension between the two opposing thoughts. To release the tension we can take one of three actions:Change our behavior.\nJustify our behavior by changing the conflicting cognition.\nJustify our behavior by adding new cognitions.Dissonance is most powerful when it is about our self-image. Feelings of foolishness, immorality and so on (including internal projections during decision-making) are dissonance in action.If an action has been completed and cannot be undone, then the after-the-fact dissonance compels us to change our beliefs. If beliefs are moved, then the dissonance appears during decision-making, forcing us to take actions we would not have taken before.Cognitive dissonance appears in virtually all evaluations and decisions and is the central mechanism by which we experience new differences in the world. When we see other people behave differently to our images of them, when we hold any conflicting thoughts, we experience dissonance.Dissonance increases with the importance and impact of the decision, along with the difficulty of reversing it.

If you do not know that a person is being threatened, then you are far more likely to assume they have a nervous disposition. This can easily happen when the situation is not physically apparent, such as when a person is in the first day of a new job.\nUnrealistic expectations. If I believe that a teacher is all-knowing, then I expect their first lesson to be as good as their hundredth. Likewise if they have just taught a lesson that bombed. Even if am aware of these factors, I expect them to perform consistently.\nInflated categorization. My expectations of the teacher are made worse if I expect all teachers to be equally competent. Likewise, if I categorize all questions as showing that you don't know things, then I might assume that when the teacher asks the student questions it is because the teacher does not know the answer.\nIncomplete corrections. I can further infer incorrectly about the teachers questions, such as that they are asking the wrong questions and hence do no understand their subject. ",

When the behavior is not what we would have forecast, we assume that it is due to their internal preferences or character traits.Information about five factors is sought to make these inferences:Whether the behavior being considered is voluntary and freely chosen.\nWhat is unexpected about the behavior (‘non-common effects’).\nWhether the behavior is socially desirable.\nWhether the behavior impacts the person doing the inferring (‘hedonic relevance’).\nWhether the behavior is of personal interest to the person doing the inferring (‘personalism’).",

These classifications can be positive or negative, such as when various nationalities are stereotyped as friendly or unfriendly.The purpose of stereotypes is to help us know how to interact with others. Each classification has associations, scripts and so on that we use to interpret what they are saying, decide if they are good or bad, and choose how to respond to them (or not).It is easier to create stereotypes when there is a clearly visible and consistent attribute that can easily be recognized. This is why people of color, police and women are so easily stereotyped.We often accept stereotypes from other people. This helps us agree on how to understand and act towards various groups of people in a consistent way.People from stereotyped groups can find this very disturbing as they experience an apprehension (stereotype threat) of being treated unfairly.We change our stereotypes infrequently. Even in the face of disconfirming evidence, we often cling to our obviously-wrong beliefs. When we do change the stereotypes, we do so in one of three ways:Bookkeeping model: As we learn new contradictory information, we incrementally adjust the stereotype to adapt to the new information. We usually need quite a lot of repeated information for each incremental change. Individual evidence is taken as the exception that proves the rule.\nConversion model: We throw away the old stereotype and start again. This is often used when there is significant disconfirming evidence.\nSubtyping model: We create a new stereotype that is a sub-classification of the existing stereotype, particularly when we can draw a boundary around the sub-class. Thus if we have a stereotype for Americans, a visit to New York may result in us having a ‘New Yorkers are different’ sub-type.We often store stereotypes in two parts. First there is the generalized descriptions and attributes. To this we may add exemplars to prove the case, such as 'the policeman next door'. We may also store them hierarchically, such as 'black people', 'Africans', 'Ugandans', 'Ugandan military', etc., with each lower order inheriting the characteristics of the higher order, with additional characteristics added.Stereotyping can go around in circles. Men stereotype women and women stereotype men. In certain societies this is intensified as the stereotyping of women pushes them together more and they create men as more of an out-group. The same thing happens with different racial groups, such as 'white/black' (an artificial system of opposites, which in origin seems to be more like 'European/non-European').Stereotyping can be subconscious, where it subtly biases our decisions and actions, even in people who consciously do not want to be biased.Stereotyping often happens not so much because of aggressive or unkind thoughts. It is more often a simplification to speed conversation on what is not considered to be an important topic.",

This is why people of color, police and women are so easily stereotyped.We often accept stereotypes from other people.

Individual evidence is taken as the exception that proves the rule.\nConversion model: We throw away the old stereotype and start again. This is often used when there is significant disconfirming evidence.\nSubtyping model: We create a new stereotype that is a sub-classification of the existing stereotype, particularly when we can draw a boundary around the sub-class. Thus if we have a stereotype for Americans, a visit to New York may result in us having a ‘New Yorkers are different’ sub-type.We often store stereotypes in two parts. First there is the generalized descriptions and attributes. To this we may add exemplars to prove the case, such as 'the policeman next door'. We may also store them hierarchically, such as 'black people', 'Africans', 'Ugandans', 'Ugandan military', etc., with each lower order inheriting the characteristics of the higher order, with additional characteristics added.Stereotyping can go around in circles. Men stereotype women and women stereotype men. In certain societies this is intensified as the stereotyping of women pushes them together more and they create men as more of an out-group. The same thing happens with different racial groups, such as 'white/black' (an artificial system of opposites, which in origin seems to be more like 'European/non-European').Stereotyping can be subconscious, where it subtly biases our decisions and actions, even in people who consciously do not want to be biased.Stereotyping often happens not so much because of aggressive or unkind thoughts. It is more often a simplification to speed conversation on what is not considered to be an important topic.",
          "example": "Stereotyping goes way beyond race and gender. Consider conversations you have had about people from the next town, another department in your company, supporters of other football teams, and so on.  ",
          "so what?": "Using itFind how others stereotype you (if possible, getting them to stereotype you positively). They will have a blind spot to non-stereotyped behaviors, so you can do these and they will often ignore it. Thus if you are stereotyped as a ‘kind old man’, you can do moderately unkind things which may be ignored.DefendingTo change a person’s view of your stereotype, be consistently different from it. Beware of your own stereotyping blinding you to the true nature of other individuals.Stereotyping can be reduced by bringing people together. When they discover the other people are not as the stereotype, the immediate evidence creates dissonance that leads to improved thoughts about the other group.",

This level will vary between relationships, with some being more giving and others where we get more from the relationship. They will also vary greatly in what is given and received. Thus, for example, exchanges at home may be very different, both in balance and content.We also have a comparison level for the alternative relationships. With a high such comparison level, we might believe the world is full of lovely people just waiting to meet us.

This can be positive or negative emotion, which indicates positive valence or negative valence.It is natural for us to want good things and so we think more about them. The reverse is generally true when we think less of bad things. The availability that this creates when we are assigning probability tends to make good things seem more likely.Of course if people are pessimistic, then they may think bad things more likely. However, most of us, most of the time, find optimism a more effective state as it can create a self-fulfilling prophecy through the motivational effects it causes. It also likely has evolutionary benefits.Because of the bias towards optimism, being slightly pessimistic is likely to make you more realistic. People whose future is inescapable, such as those with a terminal illness can be more realistic in this way.FMRi tests have shown that optimism is related to reduced coding of undesirable information about the future in the frontal cortex that has been is sensitive to negative estimation errors.The 'Polyanna' effect is where a person sees good in all things and is overly optimistic. Whilst some optimism can be helpful, being unremittingly positive is probably not the best survival strategy.The valence effect is sometimes also called 'wishful thinking' or 'optimism bias'.",

If I believe I am good but do something bad, then the discomfort I feel as a result is cognitive dissonance.Cognitive dissonance is a very powerful motivator which will often lead us to change one or other of the conflicting belief or action. The discomfort often feels like a tension between the two opposing thoughts. To release the tension we can take one of three actions:Change our behavior.\nJustify our behavior by changing the conflicting cognition.\nJustify our behavior by adding new cognitions.Dissonance is most powerful when it is about our self-image. Feelings of foolishness, immorality and so on (including internal projections during decision-making) are dissonance in action.If an action has been completed and cannot be undone, then the after-the-fact dissonance compels us to change our beliefs. If beliefs are moved, then the dissonance appears during decision-making, forcing us to take actions we would not have taken before.Cognitive dissonance appears in virtually all evaluations and decisions and is the central mechanism by which we experience new differences in the world.

This is to misunderstand the law of large numbers, where a large number of random events, such as coin tossing, will closely approach the natural distribution (eg. 50% heads and 50% tails).A critical element of the fallacy is that wins and losses will balance themselves out in the short term, rather than the long term, such that several losses means wins are more likely. The truth is when the driver is random chance, the probability of winning or losing is always the same each time.This fallacy can appear as a contradiction to the Hot Hand Phenomenon, where a run of success is assumed to continue.In the more general description of the gambler's fallacy, it includes the assumption of a run of luck or 'winning streak', where because I have won several times I feel I am more likely to continue winning.Other false predictions around luck include assumptions of luck running out and being on a losing streak.Generally we all need to explain our experiences (as in attribution theory) and gamblers are no different. They thus form theories about why they are winning or losing based on luck and their own skill. Recency and availability effects also have an impact on predictions.",

In particular, we tend to be more optimistic about our own chances than we do about other people.Optimism bias can be assessed by asking people how likely they are to fail or experience something negative as compared with others. Many of us think they will face less risk and negative outcomes than others.With regard to emotion, being optimistic makes us feel better for longer. When we believe we will benefit from a future event, we feel good about this as we think of ourselves in that situation and feel anticipatory pleasure. Even if the event does not happen, we only feel bad at that time and can easily move on to other positive thinking, such as when we tell ourselves 'It'll be better next time'.There are evolutionary benefits for optimism. Optimistic people will try more things that those who are more cautious. Certainly, over-optimism can lead to at best a waste of time and at worst loss of life. Yet even this helps evolution of people who have the right amount of optimism. Overall, optimism and consequent experimentation leads to learning and that some people, at least, will make breakthroughs that would not be achieved if we were all more realistic. This spreads beyond humans as animals will also display optimism.Optimism is affected by temperament, where some people are generally more optimistic than others. It is also affected by shorter-term mood, for example a person who is feeling depressed is less likely to be optimistic. Indeed, those who are depressed or who are generally in a negative frame of mind may tend towards an opposite, pessimistic bias. Optimism is also moderated by caution and the desire to avoid or reduce risks.Selective memory tends to affect optimism when we recall past successes and positive events more easily than negative ones (which we may ignore or suppress).Other factors that affect optimism include:The degree of control a person believes they have.\nThe amount of support they person thinks they have from other people.\nThe successes the person has had in the past.\nWhere action is necessary and caution is not likely to be helpful.\nTendency towards self-confidence, arrogance and other thoughts that create cognitive self-bias.\nThe perceived probability and impact of the desired event.\nThe perceived probability and impact of negative events should the desired event not occur.\nThe extent to which we have told other people we will succeed.Optimism is also encouraged within many cultures, where being positive receives more desirable feedback and being negative leads to criticism or less desirable feedback. In other words, we prefer people who are optimistic. Even when we know they are probably wrong, cheerful people who think the future will be good make us feel happier.",

People who are exhibiting restraint bias and believe they can withstand urges are more likely to allow temptation to be put in their way. Optimism about our ability to control urges is ill-founded, it seems.The underlying problem is in the different mental state between thinking about being in an urge state and actually being in the urge state.

However, to live together, we need to agree on common beliefs, values, attitudes and behaviors that reduce in-group threats act for the common good.We thus learn to conform to rules of other people. And the more we see others behaving in a certain way or making particular decisions, the more we feel obliged to follow suit.This will happen even when we are in a group of complete strangers. We will go along with the others to avoid looking like a fool. However the forces are strongest when we care most about respect and love from others in the group. Thus families and friends can apply very strong normative influence.People with lower self-esteem and who crave approval of others may well be more easily influenced this way.When a person in a group does not conform, then they may be considered a deviant and both private and public advice may be given to them on how to fit in. If they still do not obey norms, they will eventually be ejected and membership of the group revoked.National culture also has a significant effect, and people in countries like Japan, who have collectivist cultures, are far more likely to be influenced than in more individualistic cultures, such as in the USA (although it is a testament to the power of this effect that it still has a massive impact here).",

There may also be some conditioning effect. The credibility of the person administering the placebo is hence another important factor, as is the manner of administration.People who are higher in ego resilience and agreeableness, and with lower angry neuroticism, tend to be more susceptible to placebos, which are reflected in their more easily forming bonds with prescribing doctors. These people also tend to have more opioid receptor activity in the brain.Alternative medicines, from acupuncture to homeopathy have been considered as working primarily (or completely) due to the placebo effect. 'Quack medicines' peddled by charlatans depend for their success on the placebo effect.Doctors know that this often works, which is why they use it when there is no clear alternative. There is an ethical dilemma with using a placebo, as it necessarily involves deception.The placebo is by no means a cure-all and there are many diseases where it has no effect. The effect also varies with the individual, their credulity and how convinced other people they meet are that it will work.More generally, the 'placebo effect' is also used to describe any situation where suggestion is used to some effect or where the principle of 'mind over body' is significant.'Placebo' is Latin for 'I shall please'.The 'nocebo effect' (Latin for 'I will harm') is a reverse of the placebo, where interventions have a negative effect.",

This plays to belonging and esteem needs as we seek the approval and friendship of others. Conformity can run very deep, as we will even change our beliefs and values to be like those of our peers and admired superiors.Compliance is where a person does something that they are asked to do by another. They may choose to comply or not to comply, although the thoughts of social reward and punishment may lead them to compliance when they really do not want to comply.Obedience is different from compliance in that it is obeying an order from someone that you accept as an authority figure. In compliance, you have some choice. In obedience, you believe that you do not have a choice. Many military officers and commercial managers are interested only in obedience.",

          "description": "When hostages are taken, some may begin to have positive feelings towards their captors, which can include love and adoption of the captors' beliefs. They may defend the captors, both verbally and even physically.The name comes from the robbery of the Kreditbanken at Norrmalmstorg in Stockholm, where bank employees were held hostage for six days in 1973. Authorities were surprised when the hostages showed attachment to their captors, even defending the captors' actions. The name 'Stockholm Syndrome' was first used by criminologist and psychiatrist Nils Bejerot, who helped the police during this period.The reasons for hostages to act this way may start with them acting in a sympathetic way in order to seek mercy from their captors. They may then change their beliefs in order sustain internal consistency between actions and beliefs. This would be supported if the captors reciprocate civil behavior.The effect may be related to fear of police action that threatens everyone, including hostages. Hostages may hence identify with captor anger at police and agree with their anger.It is also possible that those who show concern for their captors are simply displaying a common humanity where they have concern for all people. This may be triggered as a reaction against others who frame the captors as unremittingly evil. From a psychoanalytic viewpoint, it seems related to transference.The Stockholm Syndrome seems likely to take hold when people are held hostage for long periods and their fear gives way to something more tolerable. It may also be more common in people who admire strength and maybe have been influenced by a dominant father.The same effect may apply when anyone is incarcerated with others who have control over them, including abductees, prisoners, cult members, battered spouses and so on.It has been suggested that Stockholm Syndrome happens on a societal level, where a patriarchal culture leads to women bonding with dominant men.According to a 2009 FBI report, only 8% of victims develop some kind of regard for their captors. Three critical factors are also identified:A significant length of time must pass before the symptoms appear (typically several days).\nThe hostages and the captors must sustain human contact.\nThe captors must treat the hostages well, or at least not abuse or threaten them.Societal Stockholm Syndrome refers to the principle being found in general society, typically in the way women sometimes view men, and can be seen in abusive relationships where the abused person will still stand up for their abuser.The Stockholm Syndrome is also known as Survival Identification Syndrome, Common Sense Syndrome, Terror-Bonding or Traumatic Bonding.'Lima Syndrome' is a reverse effect, where captors feel sympathy towards their hostages. This is named after a 1966 abduction at the Japanese Embassy in Lima, Peru.",

Ecstasy on reciprocation, despair on rejection.\nCommitment: The readiness to do anything for the sake of the love.These combine to create seven styles:Liking: Intimacy alone\nInfatuation: Passion alone\nEmpty love: Commitment alone\nRomantic love: Passion + Intimacy.\nCompanionate love: Intimacy + Commitment\nFatuous love: Passion + Commitment\nConsummate love: Intimacy + Passion + CommitmentThe games of love are played on six different stages, and individuals will have preferred modes (Lee):Eros: Passionate and physical.

          "description": "When hostages are taken, some may begin to have positive feelings towards their captors, which can include love and adoption of the captors' beliefs. They may defend the captors, both verbally and even physically.The name comes from the robbery of the Kreditbanken at Norrmalmstorg in Stockholm, where bank employees were held hostage for six days in 1973. Authorities were surprised when the hostages showed attachment to their captors, even defending the captors' actions. The name 'Stockholm Syndrome' was first used by criminologist and psychiatrist Nils Bejerot, who helped the police during this period.The reasons for hostages to act this way may start with them acting in a sympathetic way in order to seek mercy from their captors. They may then change their beliefs in order sustain internal consistency between actions and beliefs. This would be supported if the captors reciprocate civil behavior.The effect may be related to fear of police action that threatens everyone, including hostages. Hostages may hence identify with captor anger at police and agree with their anger.It is also possible that those who show concern for their captors are simply displaying a common humanity where they have concern for all people. This may be triggered as a reaction against others who frame the captors as unremittingly evil. From a psychoanalytic viewpoint, it seems related to transference.The Stockholm Syndrome seems likely to take hold when people are held hostage for long periods and their fear gives way to something more tolerable. It may also be more common in people who admire strength and maybe have been influenced by a dominant father.The same effect may apply when anyone is incarcerated with others who have control over them, including abductees, prisoners, cult members, battered spouses and so on.It has been suggested that Stockholm Syndrome happens on a societal level, where a patriarchal culture leads to women bonding with dominant men.According to a 2009 FBI report, only 8% of victims develop some kind of regard for their captors. Three critical factors are also identified:A significant length of time must pass before the symptoms appear (typically several days).\nThe hostages and the captors must sustain human contact.\nThe captors must treat the hostages well, or at least not abuse or threaten them.Societal Stockholm Syndrome refers to the principle being found in general society, typically in the way women sometimes view men, and can be seen in abusive relationships where the abused person will still stand up for their abuser.The Stockholm Syndrome is also known as Survival Identification Syndrome, Common Sense Syndrome, Terror-Bonding or Traumatic Bonding.'Lima Syndrome' is a reverse effect, where captors feel sympathy towards their hostages.

Seeing them less often.\nNegative identity management: ‘We each should see other people…’\nJustification: ‘This relationship is not giving me what I want.’Duck shows a four phase model:Relationship phase. The relationship is fairly healthy, but dissatisfaction builds up with feelings of ‘there’s something wrong.’ Eventually The ‘I can’t stand it any more’ feelings build up to a point which catapults you into the breakdown stages.\nIntrapsychic phase. Nothing much is said, but now the focus is on the faults of the other partner. Evidence is sought by which they can be blamed for any problems. When enough evidence is accumulated, the person feels justified in withdrawing.\nDyadic phase. The breakdown now comes out into the open, either with one person saying ‘I’m leaving’ or ‘I’m thinking of leaving’. Reality must now be faced by both partners and intensive discussions may ensue. The focus here is on the partnership. Eventually the pressure of ‘I really mean it’ breaks out and it becomes a public issue.\nSocial phase. Now the focus turns outwards to the perceptions of other people. Friends may be recruited to either camp and entire social groups may break into open battles of who is to blame and what should be done. Eventually, it becomes inevitable that the split will happen and things move on to the next phase.There can also be a fifth phase:Grave-dressing phase.

          "description": "Offer them something that appears to be very good value. This should be a real bargain, an offer they can't possibly refuse, even if they were not thinking about it.Later, replace the item with something of less value to them (and more profit to you).",
          "example": "A car sales showroom puts a basic car outside with a very low price-tag. Once the customer is interested, the sales person trades them up to a more expensive model.Would you like to go out to this really expensive restaurant? ... Oh dear, it's booked up. Never mind, we can go to the usual place.",
          "discussion": "When the person sees the initial item of high value they cognitively close on the idea of acquiring it and hence  The early bait thus moves them from a negative position to one of commitment.When the high value item is removed, then they enter a state of anxiety in which they seek to re-enter the comfortable closed state. They thus seek to satisfice, accepting almost any solution that will get them back to that comfortable state.There may also be an element of commitment to the person making the offer. If I offer something to you, you feel some obligation to me. If I then switch the offer, especially if the switching seems reasonable, then you are likely to accept the second offer out of a sense of obligation to me. To do otherwise would expose myself as inconsistent and break bonding between us.Although common in sales, this method was first researched by Joule, Gouilloux, and Weber (1989), who called it the lure procedure. They invited students to watch interesting film clips (and hence got a lot of volunteers), but then switched the task to memorizing lists of numbers. In the control group that was just asked to help by memorizing numbers (no initial film-clip offer), only 15% agreed, as opposed to 47% who had been first offered the film-clip experiment.Bait-and-switch is similar to Low-ball. Low-ball is used in a single transaction, for example in the direct conversation between a customer and a sales person. In bait-and-switch, the bait (such as in an advert) is often separate from the direct sales activity during which the switch is made, for example by saying the advertised product is not available (but a higher-priced, similar product is). Also, low-balling is often based more in money, while bait-and-switch typically is about different products. The bait and switch technique is a 'sequential request'.",

They may also have become disillusioned with the group purpose, process or leadership and are seeking a viable alternative.There are four major factors that give the minority its power:Consistency: Being consistent in expressing minority group opinion.\nConfidence: Being sure about the correctness of ideas and views presented.\nUnbiased: Appearing to be reasonable and unbiased in presenting ideas.\nResistance: Resisting the natural social pressure and abuse that the majority may bring to bear on minority members.In addition, to gain the confidence of the 'silent majority', the minority shows that it is not like the leadership of the majority, typically by visibly opposing them (something most of the silent majority would not dare do).

          "discussion": "DITF works by first getting a no and then getting a yes.When the other person refuses the first request, they may feel guilty about having refused another person and fear rejection as a result. The second request gives them the opportunity to assuage that guilt and mitigate any threat of social rejection. In effect, the person making the request is making an exchange of concession for belonging.The lower request uses the contrast principle, making it seem very small in comparison with the larger initial request and hence relatively trivial and easy to agree with.This method works best when the requests being made have a socially valid element, for example where you are seeking to learn something, teach people or help others. This is so that the other person does not reject the whole request out of hand (it is just that the initial request is 'too much').The second request should be made soon after the first request, before the effects of guilt and other motivators wears off. Cialdini, Cacioppo, Bassett, and Miller asked students to to volunteer to council juvenile delinquents for two hours a week for two years. After their refusal, they were asked to chaperone juvenile delinquents on a one-day trip to the zoo. 50% agreed to chaperone the trip to the zoo as compared to 17% of participants who only received the zoo request.The Door-in-the-face technique is a 'sequential request' and is also known as 'rejection-then-retreat'.",

          "discussion": "FITD works by first getting a small yes and then getting an even better yes.The principle involved is that a small agreement creates a bond between the requester and the requestee. The other person has to justify their agreement to themself. They cannot use the first request as something significant, so they have to convince themself that it is because they are nice and like the requester or that they actually are interested in the item being requested. In a future request, they then feel obliged to act consistently with their internal explanation they have built.The initial request should be:..small enough so that they are less likely to refuse the request.\n..big enough so the target person feels they are being kind when they respond.\n..for a good reason that the giver agrees is worthwhile.\n..something that the person will do voluntary (not requiring external incentives such as pressure or money).It can help if there is some label given, such as the sticky badges that charities often give out after a donation.It does not matter when there isFreedman and Fraser (1966) asked people to either sign a petition or place a small card in a window in their home or car about keeping California beautiful or supporting safe driving. About two weeks later, the same people were asked by a second person to put a large sign advocating safe driving in their front yard. Many people who agreed to the first request now complied with the second, far more intrusive request.The Freedman and Fraser study showed significant effect. later studies showed that the actual effect was more often far less.The most powerful effect occurs when the person's self-image is aligned with the request. Requests thus need to be kept close to issues that the person is likely to support, such as helping other people. It is also affected by individual need for consistency.Pro-social requests also increase likelihood of success with this method. It is also more likely to succeed when the second request is an extension of the first request (as opposed to being something completely different).Note also that 'foot in the door' is also used as a generic term to describe where early sales are relatively unprofitable (maybe a 'loss leader'), as the key purpose is to enable a relationship to be developed whereby further and more profitable sales may be completed.The Foot-in-the-door technique is a 'sequential request'.",

Typically, primed ideas are effective for around 24 hours. Conceptual priming occurs where related ideas are used to prime the response, for example 'hat' may prime for 'head'.Semantic priming occurs where the meaning created influences later thoughts. Semantic and conceptual priming are very similar and the terms may be used interchangeably.Non-associative semantic priming refers to related concepts but where one is less likely to trigger thoughts of the other, for example 'Sun' and 'Venus'.Perceptual priming, is based on the form of the stimulus, for example where a part-picture is completed based on a picture seen earlier.Associative priming happens when a linked idea is primed, for example when 'bread' primes the thought of 'butter'. This particularly applies to 'free association' word pairs.Masked priming occurs where a word or image is presented for a very short time but is not consciously recognized.Repetitive priming occurs where the repetition of something leads to it influencing later thoughts.Reverse priming occurs where people realize they are being primed and, feeling they have been biased, over-respond in their choices which are now biased in the reverse direction.",

This plays to belonging and esteem needs as we seek the approval and friendship of others. Conformity can run very deep, as we will even change our beliefs and values to be like those of our peers and admired superiors.Compliance is where a person does something that they are asked to do by another. They may choose to comply or not to comply, although the thoughts of social reward and punishment may lead them to compliance when they really do not want to comply.Obedience is different from compliance in that it is obeying an order from someone that you accept as an authority figure. In compliance, you have some choice. In obedience, you believe that you do not have a choice. Many military officers and commercial managers are interested only in obedience.",

He claimed that putting a very short message in a film, ‘drink Coca-Cola’ resulted in increased sales of Coke. It was very successful for him and fooled a whole generation and maybe more.Thus the field of subliminal persuasion was born, with the promise that a message that is not consciously noticed will have a significant effect on the subconscious.Although some experiments got limited success, the big claims came from improperly conducted experiments, for example with no controls.More recent experiments have shown that there is some effect, although not excessive.

        "details": {
          "description": "We have both friends and acquaintances. Our friends are often a part of a close-knit group who largely know one another. Our acquaintances are far less likely to know one another.In terms of connection with general society and staying in touch with what is going on in the wider world, the weak ties with our acquaintances are paradoxically much more important than the inwardly-focused conversations with our closer friends. Indeed, the information we discuss with our friends often comes from wider sources.In the familiarity of strong ties we use simple restricted codes, where much is implicit and taken for granted. In communicating through the weak ties, we need more explicit elaborated codes for meaning to be fully communicated. When elaborating, we have more scope for creativity and the thought that it stimulates makes innovation more likely.The more weak ties we have, the more connected to the world we are and are more likely to receive important information about ideas, threats and opportunities in time to respond to them.Societies and social systems that have more weak ties are more likely to be dynamic and innovative. If the system is mostly made up of strong ties, then it will be fragmented and uncoordinated.Some weak ties are better than others. Weak ties to friends of your friends are not as useful as weak ties elsewhere as the information and further connections are likely to be similar to those of your friends. Weak ties that join separate social groups are called bridges.You can also find absent ties, where you might expect a tie but it does not exist, for example in a group of friends where two people are still distant from one another.As there are usually more people in lower classes, they have greater choice of friends and greater chance of finding similar 'people like me' and so compensate by having more strong ties. Economic uncertainty also leads to the search for contingencies and poorer people invest far more in building multiple strong ties who will directly help them if they are in difficulty. However this may serve to anchor their status further and reduce the chance of upward social mobility.Upper class people are more relaxed about weak ties and so tend to have more. However, they have to resort to expensive clubs and other filtering mechanisms to find 'people like them' with whom they can build stronger ties.The modern approach to business networking is based on the principle of weak ties: having a wide range of acquaintances can be far more helpful than having just a few good friends. Weak ties are also useful for activists who need to mobilize large protest or action groups.Weak ties are the channels of culture and are woven into successful organisations where many know many others on first-name terms. Three types of weak ties that may be found in towns and cities are social (casual friendship), community (eg. neighbors) and profesional (job-related).",
          "research": "Granovetter's original 1973 research into the subject looked at how people find jobs. He discovered that information about jobs that led to employment was more likely to come from the weak ties with acquaintances than from closer friends.There were several moderators of this finding, for example that this 'weak ties finds jobs' was more common in higher status individuals, and that people who had been out of work for longer were more likely to find jobs via their stronger ties.",

This is our 'theory of mind' about them (sometimes abbreviated to 'ToM'). We even do the same to ourselves, stepping back and watching ourselves think and feel as we try to work out who we really are.In particular, we predict the intent of others, which helps us decide whether they are a threat or otherwise we should pre-emptively respond to their likely actions.It is also notable how we evaluate what others are thinking and may conclude that they are wrong (eg. with a false belief). This gives us the opportunity to either correct their thinking or take advantage of their apparent misunderstanding.This theory will be shaped by stereotypes and other simplifying schemas about people that we use, including our understanding of ourselves and our own thought processes.In the short term with strangers we use available signals, including facial expressions and other non-verbal signals. Longer-term we use our accumulated knowledge about an individual and the models we have built about them.We then often go on to assume that our guesses are true, interacting with others through our theory of mind, acting as if it were true. This can lead to all kinds of misinterpretations and misunderstanding.Done well, using theory of mind can be very helpful in working with others and enables us to better fit into a social context, even to the point of adopting the perceived thought processes of others. Done badly, it is common source of conflict. It can easily be affected by our own mental state, for example if we are angry or feeling judgemental, we will easily assume others have bad or evil intent.Children do not start out with a developed theory of mind process. This appears around the age of four and can be seen as they improve their assessments of what others will do.Empathy is similar to theory of mind but is more about understanding what others are feeling, as opposed to the theory of mind focus on thinking.",
          "research": "Although it has been of philosophical interest for some time, modern work on theory of mind started with primate research, where Premack and Woodruff sought to understand the complexity of chimpanzee thinking.In humans, Baron-Cohen found that understanding of attention in others appears in infants around 7 to 9 months, as and is a critical precursor to developing theory of mind.Meltzoff identified how we use theory of mind in learning, not only imitating what others do but what they appear to think.Research with children has successfully been done with dolls playing out a scenario and identifying what assumptions the child makes about what the dolls  'think'.",

Attention was thus put on discovering these traits, often by studying successful leaders, but with the underlying assumption that if other people could also be found with these traits, then they, too, could also become great leaders.Stogdill (1974) identified the following traits and skills as critical to leaders. Traits\tSkills\n\nAdaptable to situations\nAlert to social environment\nAmbitious and achievement-orientated\nAssertive\nCooperative\nDecisive\nDependable\nDominant (desire to influence others)\nEnergetic (high activity level)\nPersistent\nSelf-confident\nTolerant of stress\nWilling to assume responsibility\n\t\nClever (intelligent)\nConceptually skilled\nCreative\nDiplomatic and tactful\nFluent in speaking\nKnowledgeable about group task\nOrganised (administrative ability)\nPersuasive\nSocially skilled\n\n  McCall and Lombardo (1983) researched both success and failure identified four primary traits by which leaders could succeed or 'derail':Emotional stability and composure: Calm, confident and predictable, particularly when under stress.\nAdmitting error: Owning up to mistakes, rather than putting energy into covering up.\nGood interpersonal skills: Able to communicate and persuade others without resort to negative or coercive tactics.\nIntellectual breadth: Able to understand a wide range of areas, rather than having a narrow (and narrow-minded) area of expertise.",
          "discussion": "There have been many different studies of leadership traits and they agree only in the general saintly qualities needed to be a leader.For a long period, inherited traits were sidelined as learned and situational factors were considered to be far more realistic as reasons for people acquiring leadership positions.Paradoxically, the research into twins who were separated at birth along with new sciences such as Behavioral Genetics have shown that far more is inherited than was previously supposed. Perhaps one day they will find a 'leadership gene'.",

          "discussion": "Behavioral is a big leap from Trait Theory, in that it assumes that leadership capability can be learned, rather than being inherent. This opens the floodgates to leadership development, as opposed to simple psychometric assessment that sorts those with leadership potential from those who will never have the chance.A behavioral theory is relatively easy to develop, as you simply assess both leadership success and the actions of leaders. With a large enough study, you can then correlate statistically significant behaviors with success. You can also identify behaviors which contribute to failure, thus adding a second layer of understanding.",

Another variant is for the leader to describe the 'what' of objectives or goals and let the team or individuals decide the 'how' of the process by which the 'how' will be achieved (this is often called 'Management by Objectives').The level of participation may also depend on the type of decision being made.

          "description": "Kurt Lewin and colleagues did leadership decision experiments in 1939 and identified three different styles of leadership, in particular around decision-making.AutocraticIn the autocratic style, the leader takes decisions without consulting with others. The decision is made without any form of consultation. In Lewin's experiments, he found that this caused the most level of discontent.An autocratic style works when there is no need for input on the decision, where the decision would not change as a result of input, and where the motivation of people to carry out subsequent actions would not be affected whether they were or were not involved in the decision-making.DemocraticIn the democratic style, the leader involves the people in the decision-making, although the process for the final decision may vary from the leader having the final say to them facilitating consensus in the group.Democratic decision-making is usually appreciated by the people, especially if they have been used to autocratic decisions with which they disagreed. It can be problematic when there are a wide range of opinions and there is no clear way of reaching an equitable final decision.Laissez-FaireThe laissez-faire style is to minimize the leader's involvement in decision-making, and hence allowing people to make their own decisions, although they may still be responsible for the outcome.Laissez-faire works best when people are capable and motivated in making their own decisions, and where there is no requirement for a central coordination, for example in sharing resources across a range of different people and groups.",
          "discussion": "In Lewin et al's experiments, he discovered that the most effective style was Democratic. Excessive autocratic styles led to revolution, whilst under a Laissez-faire approach, people were not coherent in their work and did not put in the energy that they did when being actively led.These experiments were actually done with groups of children, but were early in the modern era and were consequently highly influential.",

Communication is almost entirely downwards and the psychologically distant concerns of people are ignored.Benevolent authoritativeWhen the leader adds concern for people to an authoritative position, a 'benevolent dictatorship' is formed. The leader now uses rewards to encourage appropriate performance and listens more to concerns lower down the organization, although what they hear is often rose-tinted, being limited to what their subordinates think that the boss wants to hear. Although there may be some delegation of decisions, almost all major decisions are still made centrally.ConsultativeThe upward flow of information here is still cautious and rose-tinted to some degree, although the leader is making genuine efforts to listen carefully to ideas. Nevertheless, major decisions are still largely centrally made.ParticipativeAt this level, the leader makes maximum use of participative methods, engaging people lower down the organization in decision-making. People across the organization are psychologically closer together and work well together at all levels.",

In practice, as they say, things are not that simple.Factors that affect situational decisions include motivation and capability of followers. This, in turn, is affected by factors within the particular situation. The relationship between followers and the leader may be another factor that affects leader behavior as much as it does follower behavior.The leaders' perception of the follower and the situation will affect what they do rather than the truth of the situation. The leader's perception of themselves and other factors such as stress and mood will also modify the leaders' behavior.Yukl (1989) seeks to combine other approaches and identifies six variables:Subordinate effort: the motivation and actual effort expended.\nSubordinate ability and role clarity: followers knowing what to do and how to do it.\nOrganization of the work: the structure of the work and utilization of resources.\nCooperation and cohesiveness: of the group in working together.\nResources and support: the availability of tools, materials, people, etc.\nExternal coordination: the need to collaborate with other groups.Leaders here work on such factors as external relationships, acquisition of resources, managing demands on the group and managing the structures and culture of the group.",
          "discussion": "Tannenbaum and Schmidt (1958) identified three forces that led to the leader's action: the forces in the situation, the forces in then follower and also forces in the leader. This recognizes that the leader's style is highly variable, and even such distant events as a family argument can lead to the displacement activity of a more aggressive stance in an argument than usual.Maier (1963) noted that leaders not only consider the likelihood of a follower accepting a suggestion, but also the overall importance of getting things done.

The leader may also provide a working structure, both for the job and in terms of how the person is controlled.The leader may first find out why the person is not motivated and if there are any limitations in ability. These two factors may be linked, for example where a person believes they are less capable than they should be may be in some form of denial or other coping. They follower may also lack self-confidence as a result.If the leader focused more on the relationship, the follower may become confused about what must be done and what is optional. The leader thus maintains a clear 'do this' position to ensure all required actions are clear.S2: Selling / CoachingFollower: R2: Some competence, variable commitment / Unable but willing or motivatedLeader: High task focus, high relationship focusWhen the follower can do the job, at least to some extent, and perhaps is over-confident about their ability in this, then 'telling' them what to do may demotivate them or lead to resistance. The leader thus needs to 'sell' another way of working, explaining and clarifying decisions.The leader thus spends time listening and advising and, where appropriate, helping the follower to gain necessary skills through coaching methods.Note: S1 and S2 are leader-driven.S3: Participating / SupportingFollower: R3: High competence, variable commitment / Able but unwilling or insecureLeader: Low task focus, high relationship focusWhen the follower can do the job, but is refusing to do it or otherwise showing insufficient commitment, the leader need not worry about showing them what to do, and instead is concerned with finding out why the person is refusing and thence persuading them to cooperate.There is less excuse here for followers to be reticent about their ability, and the key is very much around motivation. If the causes are found then they can be addressed by the leader. The leader thus spends time listening, praising and otherwise making the follower feel good when they show the necessary commitment.S4: Delegating / ObservingFollower: R4: High competence, high commitment / Able and willing or motivatedLeader: Low task focus, low relationship focusWhen the follower can do the job and is motivated to do it, then the leader can basically leave them to it, largely trusting them to get on with the job although they also may need to keep a relatively distant eye on things to ensure everything is going to plan.Followers at this level have less need for support or frequent praise, although as with anyone, occasional recognition is always welcome.Note: S3 and S4 are follower-led.",

Two are autocratic (A1 and A2), two are consultative (C1 and C2) and one is Group based (G2).A1: Leader takes known information and then decides alone.A2: Leader gets information from followers, and then decides alone.C1: Leader shares problem with followers individually, listens to ideas and then decides alone.C2: Leader shares problems with followers as a group, listens to ideas and then decides alone.G2: Leader shares problems with followers as a group and then seeks and accepts consensus agreement. Situational factors that influence the method are relatively logical:When decision quality is important and followers possess useful information, then A1 and A2 are not the best method.\nWhen the leader sees decision quality as important but followers do not, then G2 is inappropriate.\nWhen decision quality is important, when the problem is unstructured and the leader lacks information / skill to make the decision alone, then G2 is best.\nWhen decision acceptance is important and followers are unlikely to accept an autocratic decision, then A1 and A2 are inappropriate.\nwhen decision acceptance is important but followers are likely to disagree with one another, then A1, A2 and C1 are not appropriate, because they do not give opportunity for differences to be resolved.\nWhen decision quality is not important but decision acceptance is critical, then G2 is the best method.\nWhen decision quality is important, all agree with this, and the decision is not likely to result from an autocratic decision then G2 is best.",

In increasing rewards, they may give occasional encouragement or pave the way with gold.This variation in approach will depend on the situation, including the follower's capability and motivation, as well as the difficulty of the job and other contextual factors.House and Mitchell (1974) describe four styles of leadership:Supportive leadershipConsidering the needs of the follower, showing concern for their welfare and creating a friendly working environment. This includes increasing the follower's self-esteem and making the job more interesting. This approach is best when the work is stressful, boring or hazardous.Directive leadershipTelling followers what needs to be done and giving appropriate guidance along the way. This includes giving them schedules of specific work to be done at specific times. Rewards may also be increased as needed and role ambiguity decreased (by telling them what they should be doing).This may be used when the task is unstructured and complex and the follower is inexperienced. This increases the follower's sense of security and control and hence is appropriate to the situation.Participative leadershipConsulting with followers and taking their ideas into account when making decisions and taking particular actions. This approach is best when the followers are expert and their advice is both needed and they expect to be able to give it.Achievement-oriented leadershipSetting challenging goals, both in work and in self-improvement (and often together). High standards are demonstrated and expected. The leader shows faith in the capabilities of the follower to succeed. This approach is best when the task is complex.",
          "discussion": "Leaders who show the way and help followers along a path are effectively 'leading'.This approach assumes that there is one right way of achieving a goal and that the leader can see it and the follower cannot. This casts the leader as the knowing person and the follower as dependent.It also assumes that the follower is completely rational and that the appropriate methods can be deterministically selected depending on the situation.",

          "discussion": "Contingency theory is similar to situational theory in that there is an assumption of no simple one right way. The main difference is that situational theory tends to focus more on the behaviors that the leader should adopt, given situational factors (often about follower behavior), whereas contingency theory takes a broader view that includes contingent factors about leader capability and other variables within the situation.",

A high LPC leader generally scores the other person as positive and a low LPC leader scores them as negative.High LPC leaders tend to have close and positive relationships and act in a supportive way, even prioritizing the relationship before the task. Low LPC leaders put the task first and will turn to relationships only when they are satisfied with how the work is going.Three factors are then identified about the leader, member and the task, as follows:Leader-Member Relations: The extent to which the leader has the support and loyalties of followers and relations with them are friendly and cooperative.\nTask structure: The extent to which tasks are standardised, documented and controlled.\nLeader's Position-power: The extent to which the leader has authority to assess follower performance and give reward or punishment.The best LPC approach depends on a combination of there three. Generally, a high LPC approach is best when leader-member relations are poor, except when the task is unstructured and the leader is weak, in which a low LPC style is better. #\tLeader-Member Relations\tTask structure\tLeader's Position- power\tMost Effective leader\n1\tGood\tStructured\tStrong\tLow LPC\n2\tGood\tStructured\tWeak\tLow LPC\n3\tGood\tUnstructured\tStrong\tLow LPC\n4\tGood\tUnstructured\tWeak\tHigh LPC\n5\tPoor\tStructured\tStrong\tHigh LPC\n6\tPoor\tStructured\tWeak\tHigh LPC\n7\tPoor\tUnstructured\tStrong\tHigh LPC\n8\tPoor\tUnstructured\tWeak\tLow LPC",

          "description": "Cognitive Resource Theory predicts that:1. A leader's cognitive ability contributes to the performance of the team only when the leader's approach is directive.When leaders are better at planning and decision-making, in order for their plans and decisions to be implemented, they need to tell people what to do, rather than hope they agree with them.When they are not better than people in the team, then a non-directive approach is more appropriate, for example where they facilitate an open discussion where the ideas of team can be aired and the best approach identified and implemented.2. Stress affects the relationship between intelligence and decision quality.When there is low stress, then intelligence is fully functional and makes an optimal contribution. However, during high stress, a natural intelligence not only makes no difference, but it may also have a negative effect. One reason for this may be that an intelligent person seeks rational solutions, which may not be available (and may be one of the causes of stress). In such situations, a leader who is inexperienced in 'gut feel' decisions is forced to rely on this unfamiliar approach. Another possibility is that the leader retreats within him/herself, to think hard about the problem, leaving the group to their own devices.3. Experience is positively related to decision quality under high stress.When there is a high stress situation and intelligence is impaired, experience of the same or similar situations enables the leader to react in appropriate ways without having to think carefully about the situation. Experience of decision-making under stress also will contribute to a better decision than trying to muddle through with brain-power alone.4. For simple tasks, leader intelligence and experience is irrelevant.When subordinates are given tasks which do not need direction or support, then it does not matter how good the leader is at making decisions, because they are easy to make, even for subordinates, and hence do not need any further support.",
          "discussion": "CRT arose out of dissatisfaction with Trait Theory.Fiedler also linked CRT with his Least Preferred Co-worker (LPC) Theory, suggesting that high LPC scores are the main drivers of directive behavior.A particularly significant aspect of CRT is the principle that intelligence is the main factor in low-stress situations, whilst experience counts for more during high-stress moments.",

          "style": "The transactional leader works through creating clear structures whereby it is clear what is required of their subordinates, and the rewards that they get for following orders. Punishments are not always mentioned, but they are also well-understood and formal systems of discipline are usually in place.The early stage of Transactional Leadership is in negotiating the contract whereby the subordinate is given a salary and other benefits, and the company (and by implication the subordinate's manager) gets authority over the subordinate.When the Transactional Leader allocates work to a subordinate, they are considered to be fully responsible for it, whether or not they have the resources or capability to carry it out. When things go wrong, then the subordinate is considered to be personally at fault, and is punished for their failure (just as they are rewarded for succeeding).The transactional leader often uses management by exception, working on the principle that if something is operating to defined (and hence expected) performance then it does not need attention. Exceptions to expectation require praise and reward for exceeding expectation, whilst some kind of corrective action is applied for performance below expectation.Whereas Transformational Leadership has more of a 'selling' style, Transactional Leadership, once the contract is in place, takes a 'telling' style.",
          "discussion": "Transactional leadership is based in contingency, in that reward or punishment is contingent upon performance.Despite much research that highlights its limitations, Transactional Leadership is still a popular approach with many managers. Indeed, in the Leadership vs. Management spectrum, it is very much towards the management end of the scale.The main limitation is the assumption of 'rational man', a person who is largely motivated by money and simple reward, and hence whose behavior is predictable. The underlying psychology is Behaviorism, including the Classical Conditioning of Pavlov and Skinner's Operant Conditioning. These theories are largely based on controlled laboratory experiments (often with animals) and ignore complex emotional factors and social values.In practice, there is sufficient truth in Behaviorism to sustain Transactional approaches. This is reinforced by the supply-and-demand situation of much employment, coupled with the effects of deeper needs, as in Maslow's Hierarchy. When the demand for a skill outstrips the supply, then Transactional Leadership often is insufficient, and other approaches are more effective.",

        "details": {
          "description": "Leader-Member Exchange Theory, also called LMX or Vertical Dyad Linkage Theory, describes how leaders in groups maintain their position through a series of tacit exchange agreements with their members.In-group and out-groupIn particular, leaders often have a special relationship with an inner circle of trusted lieutenants, assistants and advisors, to whom they give high levels of responsibility, decision influence, and access to resources. This in-group pay for their position. They work harder, are more committed to task objectives, and share more administrative duties. They are also expected to be fully committed and loyal to their leader. The out-group, on the other hand, are given low levels of choice or influence.This also puts constraints upon the leader. They have to nurture the relationship with their inner circle whilst balancing giving them power with ensuring they do not have enough to strike out on their own.The LMX processThese relationships, if they are going to happen, start very soon after a person joins the group and follow three stages.1. Role takingThe member joins the team and the leader assesses their abilities and talents. Based on this, the leader may offer them opportunities to demonstrate their capabilities.Another key factor in this stage is the discovery by both parties of how the other likes to be respected.2. Role makingIn the second phase, the leader and member take part in an unstructured and informal negotiation whereby a role is created for the member and the often-tacit promise of benefit and power in return for dedication and loyalty takes place.Trust-building is very important in this stage, and any felt betrayal, especially by the leader, can result in the member being relegated to the out-group.This negotiation includes relationship factors as well as pure work-related ones, and a member who is similar to the leader in various ways is more likely to succeed. This perhaps explains why mixed gender relationships regularly are less successful than same-gender ones (it also affects the seeking of respect in the first stage). The same effect also applies to cultural and racial differences.3. RoutinizationIn this phase, a pattern of ongoing social exchange between the leader and the member becomes established.Success factorsSuccessful members are thus similar in many ways to the leader (which perhaps explains why many senior teams are all white, male, middle-class and middle-aged). They work hard at building and sustaining trust and respect.To help this, they are empathetic, patient, reasonable, sensitive, and are good at seeing the viewpoint of other people (especially the leader). Aggression, sarcasm and an egocentric view are keys to the out-group wash-room.The overall quality of the LMX relationship varies with several factors. Curiously, it is better when the challenge of the job is extremely high or extremely low. The size of the group, financial resource availability and the overall workload are also important.Onwards and upwardsThe principle works upwards as well. The leader also gains power by being a member of their manager's inner circle, which then can then share on downwards. People at the bottom of an organization with unusual power may get it from an unbroken chain of circles up to the hierarchy.",
          "so what?": "Using itWhen you join a team, work hard to also join the inner circle. Take on more than your share of administrative and other tasks. Demonstrate unswerving loyalty. See your leader's point of view. Be reasonable and supportive in your challenges to them, and pick your moments carefully.As a leader, pick your inner circle with care. Reward them for their loyalty and hard work, whilst being careful about maintaining commitment of other people.DefendingIf you want to be an 'ordinary' member of a team, play your part carefully.

          "style": "Working for a Transformational Leader can be a wonderful and uplifting experience. They put passion and energy into everything. They care about you and want you to succeed.Developing the visionTransformational Leadership starts with the development of a vision, a view of the future that will excite and convert potential followers. This vision may be developed by the leader, by the senior team or may emerge from a broad series of discussions. The important factor is the leader buys into it, hook, line and sinker.Selling the visionThe next step, which in fact never stops, is to constantly sell the vision. This takes energy and commitment, as few people will immediately buy into a radical vision, and some will join the show much more slowly than others. The Transformational Leader thus takes every opportunity and will use whatever works to convince others to climb on board the bandwagon.In order to create followers, the Transformational Leader has to be very careful in creating trust, and their personal integrity is a critical part of the package that they are selling. In effect, they are selling themselves as well as the vision.Finding the way forwardsIn parallel with the selling activity is seeking the way forward. Some Transformational Leaders know the way, and simply want others to follow them. Others do not have a ready strategy, but will happily lead the exploration of possible routes to the promised land.The route forwards may not be obvious and may not be plotted in details, but with a clear vision, the direction will always be known. Thus finding the way forward can be an ongoing process of course correction, and the Transformational Leader will accept that there will be failures and blind canyons along the way. As long as they feel progress is being made, they will be happy.Leading the chargeThe final stage is to remain up-front and central during the action. Transformational Leaders are always visible and will stand up to be counted rather than hide behind their troops. They show by their attitudes and actions how everyone else should behave. They also make continued efforts to motivate and rally their followers, constantly doing the rounds, listening, soothing and enthusing.It is their unswerving commitment as much as anything else that keeps people going, particularly through the darker times when some may question whether the vision can ever be achieved. If the people do not believe that they can succeed, then their efforts will flag. The Transformational Leader seeks to infect and reinfect their followers with a high level of commitment to the vision.One of the methods the Transformational Leader uses to sustain motivation is in the use of ceremonies, rituals and other cultural symbolism. Small changes get big hurrahs, pumping up their significance as indicators of real progress.Overall, they balance their attention between action that creates progress and the mental state of their followers. Perhaps more than other approaches, they are people-oriented and believe that success comes first and last through deep and sustained commitment.",
          "discussion": "Whilst the Transformational Leader seeks overtly to transform the organization, there is also a tacit promise to followers that they also will be transformed in some way, perhaps to be more like this amazing leader. In some respects, then, the followers are the product of the transformation.Transformational Leaders are often charismatic, but are not as narcissistic as pure Charismatic Leaders, who succeed through a belief in themselves rather than a belief in others.One of the traps of Transformational Leadership is that passion and confidence can easily be mistaken for truth and reality. Whilst it is true that great things have been achieved through enthusiastic leadership, it is also true that many passionate people have led the charge right over the cliff and into a bottomless chasm. Just because someone believes they are right, it does not mean they are right.Paradoxically, the energy that gets people going can also cause them to give up. Transformational Leaders often have large amounts of enthusiasm which, if relentlessly applied, can wear out their followers.Transformational Leaders also tend to see the big picture, but not the details, where the devil often lurks. If they do not have people to take care of this level of information, then they are usually doomed to fail.Finally, Transformational Leaders, by definition, seek to transform. When the organization does not need transforming and people are happy as they are, then such a leader will be frustrated. Like wartime leaders, however, given the right situation they come into their own and can be personally responsible for saving entire companies.",

Two key charismatic effects that transformational leaders achieve is to evoke strong emotions and to cause identification of the followers with the leader. This may be through stirring appeals. It may also may occur through quieter methods such as coaching and mentoring.Bass has recently noted that authentic transformational leadership is grounded in moral foundations that are based on four components:Idealized influence\nInspirational motivation\nIntellectual stimulation\nIndividualized consideration...and three moral aspects:The moral character of the leader.\nThe ethical values embedded in the leader’s vision, articulation, and program (which followers either embrace or reject).\nThe morality of the processes of social ethical choice and action that leaders and followers engage in and collectively pursue.This is in contrast with pseudo-transformational leadership, where, for example, in-group/out-group 'us and them' games are used to bond followers to the leader.",

This can be detected via lie detectors, speech errors and hesitations, repetitions, fidgeting and displacement activity, blinking, higher vocal pitch and pupil dilation.\nBehavior control: We try to control body language that might give us away. In fact this is impossible and leakage often occurs, for example where we are controlling our face and our legs give us away.\nEmotion: Our emotions change when we are lying. For example, duping delight, where the liar is secretly pleased at their perceived success. Guilt may also appear. Micro-motions in facial muscles can betray hidden emotions.\nThinking: To lie, we usually have to think a lot harder, such as to ensure coherence in our arguments.

There may also be some conditioning effect. The credibility of the person administering the placebo is hence another important factor, as is the manner of administration.People who are higher in ego resilience and agreeableness, and with lower angry neuroticism, tend to be more susceptible to placebos, which are reflected in their more easily forming bonds with prescribing doctors. These people also tend to have more opioid receptor activity in the brain.Alternative medicines, from acupuncture to homeopathy have been considered as working primarily (or completely) due to the placebo effect. 'Quack medicines' peddled by charlatans depend for their success on the placebo effect.Doctors know that this often works, which is why they use it when there is no clear alternative. There is an ethical dilemma with using a placebo, as it necessarily involves deception.The placebo is by no means a cure-all and there are many diseases where it has no effect. The effect also varies with the individual, their credulity and how convinced other people they meet are that it will work.More generally, the 'placebo effect' is also used to describe any situation where suggestion is used to some effect or where the principle of 'mind over body' is significant.'Placebo' is Latin for 'I shall please'.The 'nocebo effect' (Latin for 'I will harm') is a reverse of the placebo, where interventions have a negative effect.",

For example a sudden noise (an unconditional stimulus, US) makes us flinch (the unconditional response, UR). If a movement is made at the same time as, or just before the noise, such as moving hands to clap loudly (conditional stimulus, CS), then the person will learn to flinch when the movement is made without the noise necessarily being there (the conditional response, CR). Thus the association is made between the US and CS, with either stimulating the same response.Classical Conditioning  does not work in all circumstances.

When two groups argue (and crowd problems are often between groups), it is like two people arguing. The three most important factors for deindividuation in a group of people are:Anonymity, so I can not be found out.\nDiffused responsibility, so I am not responsible for my actions.\nGroup size, as a larger group increases the above two factors. When you are in a group, you may feel a shared responsibility and so less individual responsibility for your actions. In this way a morally questionable act may seem less personally wrong. You may also feel a strong need to conform to social norms.A paradox of deindividuation is that when you let go of your self, returning to you self can be an exhilarating experience.

We therefore need to control these and a key part of childhood is spend in learning this discipline. We also need to do things that we do not necessarily want to do, which also requires inner control.There are a number negative emotions that we may experience, from anger to fear, yet in social situations there is a common value that such emotions should be suppressed rather than expressed. Such control also takes ongoing effort, peaking at the moments when there internal pressure to say or do something that might later be regretted.This self-management takes constant emotional and cognitive effort. In these acts of self-control and will-power, some acts take more effort than others. Overall, though, there is almost always some ongoing effort in staying socially acceptable.We have limited resources for this task, which can run low, leaving us exhausted and vulnerable. In this state we may make more errors and our decision-making ability may well be impaired. We may also be more liable to outbursts, such as of anger or shock. As control loosens emotions intensify, including positive ones, and the person may become more excited.In a Freudian sense, this self-control uses the conscious 'ego' to control the basic desires of the 'id'. Hence as it gets worn down through exercise, the ego becomes depleted.Ego depletion tend to result in greater attention to the short term with priority being given to this and consequent ignoring of longer-term factors. This can lead to unwise decisions.The depletion that is caused may be restored to some extend by rest and positive experiences.

          "description": "When hostages are taken, some may begin to have positive feelings towards their captors, which can include love and adoption of the captors' beliefs. They may defend the captors, both verbally and even physically.The name comes from the robbery of the Kreditbanken at Norrmalmstorg in Stockholm, where bank employees were held hostage for six days in 1973. Authorities were surprised when the hostages showed attachment to their captors, even defending the captors' actions. The name 'Stockholm Syndrome' was first used by criminologist and psychiatrist Nils Bejerot, who helped the police during this period.The reasons for hostages to act this way may start with them acting in a sympathetic way in order to seek mercy from their captors. They may then change their beliefs in order sustain internal consistency between actions and beliefs. This would be supported if the captors reciprocate civil behavior.The effect may be related to fear of police action that threatens everyone, including hostages. Hostages may hence identify with captor anger at police and agree with their anger.It is also possible that those who show concern for their captors are simply displaying a common humanity where they have concern for all people. This may be triggered as a reaction against others who frame the captors as unremittingly evil. From a psychoanalytic viewpoint, it seems related to transference.The Stockholm Syndrome seems likely to take hold when people are held hostage for long periods and their fear gives way to something more tolerable. It may also be more common in people who admire strength and maybe have been influenced by a dominant father.The same effect may apply when anyone is incarcerated with others who have control over them, including abductees, prisoners, cult members, battered spouses and so on.It has been suggested that Stockholm Syndrome happens on a societal level, where a patriarchal culture leads to women bonding with dominant men.According to a 2009 FBI report, only 8% of victims develop some kind of regard for their captors. Three critical factors are also identified:A significant length of time must pass before the symptoms appear (typically several days).\nThe hostages and the captors must sustain human contact.\nThe captors must treat the hostages well, or at least not abuse or threaten them.Societal Stockholm Syndrome refers to the principle being found in general society, typically in the way women sometimes view men, and can be seen in abusive relationships where the abused person will still stand up for their abuser.The Stockholm Syndrome is also known as Survival Identification Syndrome, Common Sense Syndrome, Terror-Bonding or Traumatic Bonding.'Lima Syndrome' is a reverse effect, where captors feel sympathy towards their hostages. This is named after a 1966 abduction at the Japanese Embassy in Lima, Peru.",

However, to live together, we need to agree on common beliefs, values, attitudes and behaviors that reduce in-group threats act for the common good.We thus learn to conform to rules of other people. And the more we see others behaving in a certain way or making particular decisions, the more we feel obliged to follow suit.This will happen even when we are in a group of complete strangers. We will go along with the others to avoid looking like a fool. However the forces are strongest when we care most about respect and love from others in the group. Thus families and friends can apply very strong normative influence.People with lower self-esteem and who crave approval of others may well be more easily influenced this way.When a person in a group does not conform, then they may be considered a deviant and both private and public advice may be given to them on how to fit in. If they still do not obey norms, they will eventually be ejected and membership of the group revoked.National culture also has a significant effect, and people in countries like Japan, who have collectivist cultures, are far more likely to be influenced than in more individualistic cultures, such as in the USA (although it is a testament to the power of this effect that it still has a massive impact here).",
